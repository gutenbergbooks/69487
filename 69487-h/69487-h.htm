those of Household Duties and
the performers of them—so it is proportionally
important that they should be well
defined and understood. It is a species of
knowledge as important to the head of a
family as necessary to the servant; and, if
thoroughly studied, would relieve life of
half its anxieties and vexations.</p>

<p>Yet, till the present book, no special attempt
to define these relations, and illustrate
these duties has ever been made. We have
had Sermons on the moral obligations of
masters and servants, and many books of
religious advice, addressed to the latter, all
good in their way; but we have had no
work, which, like the present, addresses
itself to the actual personal practice of their
duties; which defines them as they actually
belong to the various classes; and instructs
servants in the way and mode of performing
them with skill, advantage, and success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[iv]</span></p>

<p>The want of such a manual of duty and
practice having often been noticed in servants’
halls, in families in which the authors
of this book have resided, it occurred to
them, many years since, to make notes, with
a view to a work like the present. They
hoped long ago to have been able to submit
them to the public; but the constant avocations
of servitude rendering it impossible
to digest their materials, the task has been
deferred till they have been enabled to retire
on a moderate competency; the publication
may therefore be regarded as the
legacy of their old age to servants of the
present and future generations, and as the
last duty which in this world they are likely
to perform.</p>

<p>The author, educated in a foundation
school, entered service as a footboy, in 1770,
and during fifty years he served successively
as groom, footman, valet, butler, and house-steward.
His Wife began the world as
maid of all work, then served as house-maid,
laundry-maid, under-cook, housekeeper and
lady’s maid, and, finally, for above twenty
years, as housekeeper in a very large establishment.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[v]</span>
Their experience is, therefore,
such as has fallen to the lot of few, and
they have freely and fully displayed it in the
following pages.</p>

<p>They profess no skill in authorship, their
sole object having been to set down every
thing likely to be useful, in language that
may be understood by all.</p>

<p>At the same time, important and necessary
as the book will be to all <span class="smcap">Servants</span>
who desire to perform their duty with ability,
and to rise in their career to higher and
more profitable situations, yet it will prove
equally useful in the parlour, by assisting
<span class="smcap">Masters</span> and <span class="smcap">Mistresses</span> of families in
arranging their establishments, advising
them of their own duties, and enabling them
to estimate the merits of valuable servants.
It may, indeed, be a question, whether the
volume will not be as desirable to those who
are served as to those who serve.</p>

<p>Conviction of its probable use to all
classes, led <span class="smcap">a lady of high rank</span>, in
whose family Mrs. Adams resided, to honour
her with advice and assistance in some
articles, particularly in that of Governess,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
and it is to be regretted that a delicate reserve
prevents the acknowledgement being
made by name.</p>

<p>At the time the work was prepared there
existed no general collection of Receipts
like that published two years since by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Mackenzie</span>, consequently, a variety of practical
receipts, which the Authors had taken
much pains to assemble, were rendered less
necessary. Nevertheless, as many of these
receipts were identified with the duties of
the several servants, they have retained the
most important of them, and it is believed
that they will be considered as adding
much to the value of the work.</p>

<p>Being desirous of rendering the volume
as perfect as possible, they will thankfully
receive, and incorporate in new editions,
any suggestions with which intelligent servants
may favour them, if addressed to
them at their publishers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> feel persuaded that the following work,
professedly written for the use and instruction
of Domestic Servants, may, with great propriety,
be dedicated to the Illustrious Heads
of Families in the United Kingdom;—to you,
who are the immediate <i>Patrons</i> of that numerous
Class of the Community. We are
aware too, that, by endeavouring to instruct
and improve those around you in the moral
and practical Duties of their respective Stations,
we best evince our attention to your
particular Interests, and indirectly promote
your Domestic Comforts:—and we feel further
assured, that the same precepts that are
calculated to teach servants the duties of their
several occupations, will serve to remind their
masters and mistresses of what they have to
expect from them. Under these impressions
we presume, with the greatest deference and
respect, to claim your patronage and protection.</p>

<p>And, though Domestic Servants are the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
Agents by means of whom the greater
part of all Household Concerns are transacted,
yet, there are many important branches of family
arrangement, the direction and controul
of which, either directly or indirectly, fall
within the sphere of the Heads of Families,
some of which are exclusively their own Concerns,
and others necessarily and unavoidably
connected with the business of Servants, but
respecting which no instruction can be given
to <i>them</i>. On these points, therefore, we shall,
in this place, take the liberty, respectfully, to
offer a few observations previous to entering
on a subject of so comprehensive and complicated
a nature as that of <i>A General Directory
for Servants</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson</span> held as a <i>maxim</i>, that “<i>Every
man’s first care is necessarily Domestic</i>.” Independent,
therefore, of public Engagements,—of
Politics, the Arts, Sciences, and Literature;—of
attention to Horses, Hounds, &amp;c.
it is considered that the first care, and the
peculiar province of the Master of a Family, is
his <i>Revenue</i>; and that attention to his Land-Stewards,
Agents, and Tenants, and to his
<i>Expenditure</i>, are the principal objects that
most immediately solicit his regard; and when
a gentleman has satisfied himself that his real
or <i>net</i> Income exceeds his Expenditure, then,
and <i>not till then</i>, may he consider himself as
an Independent Man—for, “it is not abundance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
that maketh rich, but Economy;” and
Lord Chesterfield has truly remarked, that
“great Fortunes frequently seduce their possessors
to ruinous profusion.” The great <i>Bacon</i>
has also observed, “that he would live <i>even</i>
with the world should calculate his Expenses
at <i>half</i> his Income, and he who would grow
Rich; at <i>one-third</i>.” A few Minutes in every
Day, spent in keeping a regular Account of all
Monies <i>received</i> and <i>spent</i>, <i>Dr.</i> and <i>Cr.</i> will
afford any gentleman the satisfaction of knowing
the true state of his affairs,—will operate
actively against excess of Expenditure,—will
imperceptibly teach him the art of <i>practical
Economy</i>, and will enable him to appropriate
due portions of his Income to the support of
his different Establishments.</p>

<p>With a view to this latter point, the following
<i>Rule</i>, though given in round numbers, may
be considered as affording Gentlemen a brief,
but tolerably correct, idea of the most eligible
and practical mode of appropriating a large
Income.—</p>

<p class="hanging8 small">Viz. 33 per Cent. or One-third, for Household Expenses,
including Provisions and all other Articles
of Household Consumption.</p>

<p class="hanging6 small">25 per Cent. or One-fourth, for Servants and Equipage
including Horses, Carriages, and Liveries.</p>

<p class="hanging6 small">25 per Cent. or One-fourth, for Clothes, Education of
Children, Medical Assistance, Pocket,
Private, and Extra Expenses; including
Entertainments, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p class="hanging6 small">12½ per Cent. or One-eighth, for Rent, Taxes, and Repairs
of House and Furniture.</p>

<p class="hanging6 small">4½ per Cent. as a Reserve for Contingencies.</p>

<p>Hence may be deduced the following general
Table of Expenses according to Income, viz.—</p>

<p>Thus may any Gentleman, with very little
trouble, apportion his Income:—and as no
two Gentlemen live <i>exactly</i> alike, this Table
will shew, by inspection only, what branch of
Expense may best be curtailed, so as to afford
an addition to any other branch, and still keep
his whole Expenses short of his actual Revenue.
It will also point out, to those who
are economically disposed, in what departments
<i>saving</i> may best be effected, as an
addition to the fund of reserve, for the augmentation
of the fortunes of Children, or for
unforeseen Contingencies.</p>

<p>Smaller Incomes must be appropriated in a
different manner; and according to the number
of Children in the family: thus the Expense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
of a family with Children will be from 1-4th
to 1-3rd for each of the Principals, and about
1-10th or 1-12th for each Child.</p>

<p>The Board Wages of Servants in general,
when the family is absent, is 10s. per Week,
for the females, and 12s. per Week for males.—Perhaps
all the servants on a large establishment
may be reckoned at an average of 10s.
per head, per Week, expense, for Board. The
Men are allowed a Pot of Ale per day, and
the Women a Pint, besides table-beer.</p>

<p>Besides the ordinary Establishment of Servants,
Noblemen and Gentlemen of superior
fortune employ Land-Stewards, Bailiffs, Wood-Wards,
Game-Keepers, Park-Keepers, Hunts-Men,
Whippers-in, Racing-Grooms, Jockies,
and others of inferior capacities: also Men-Cooks,
Groom of the Chambers, Page, Lady’s-Coachman,
Postillion and Footman, Seamstress,
Second Lady’s-Maid, Chamber-Maids,
Boy for the Steward’s Room, another for the
Hall, and various other Servants.</p>

<p>Having premised thus much as to income,
and its proportionate appropriation, we next
proceed to offer a few hints on such parts of
interior management, as in most families are
considered as belonging to the lady, or mistress
of the house.</p>

<p>The first is, naturally, the attention due to
her husband and children—to make home,
“<i>sweet home</i>,” the pleasing refuge of a husband,
fatigued, perhaps, by his intercourse with
a jarring world,—to be his enlightened companion,
and the chosen friend of his bosom.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>“these, these are woman’s duties, and delightful
ones they are! Happy the man who
can call her his wife; blessed are the children
who call her mother!” For the foregoing sentiments
we are indebted to an amiable and
celebrated authoress of the present day, and
to the no less celebrated and amiable <i>Thomson</i>;
and we feel impelled to quote the concluding
sentence of the above-mentioned lady,
on this interesting subject.</p>

<p>“When we thus observe the mistress of a
family exercising her activity and best abilities
in appropriate cares and increasing excellence,
are we not ready to say she is the agent for
good, of that benevolent being who placed
her on earth to fulfil such sacred obligations,
and not to waste the talents committed to her
charge.”</p>

<p>“Next to the care and attention due to your
husband and children,” says another female<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
writer, “your servants claim, as your nearest
dependents; and to promote their good, both
spiritual and temporal, is your indispensable
duty.—Let them join your family devotions,
and endeavour to make them spend their Sabbath
properly.” She further adds, “It was
the remark of an old domestic, that the worst
mistresses a servant can live with are young
married women—They are unreasonable,”
said she, “in their commands; they expect too
much; nor do they rightly know when to
commend, or when to blame.”</p>

<p>In your manner to your servants, be firm,
without being severe, and kind, without being
familiar. Never converse familiarly with them,
unless on business, or on some point connected
with their improvement; but with this
reserve, and distance of manner, be particularly
careful to maintain kindness, gentleness,
and respect for their feelings. Their patience
is often unnecessarily exercised, and their
tempers wantonly irritated. “I have been
sometimes shocked,” says the same amiable
writer, “with the want of politeness, by which
masters and mistresses provoke impertinence
from their servants.”—A lady, who filled every
station of life with honour, both to her head
and heart, attending the death-bed of an old
domestic, who had been thirty years in her
service—“How do you find yourself, to-day,
Mary?” said the mistress, taking hold of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
withered hand. “Is that you, my <i>darling
mistress</i>!” and a beam of joy overspread the
old woman’s face; “O, yes,” she added,
looking up, “it is you, my kind, my <i>mannerly</i>
mistress!” The poor old creature said no
more; but she had, by that last simple sentence,
expressed volumes of panegyric on her
amiable mistress. Human nature is the same
in all stations; and if you strive to convince
your servants that you have a generous and
compassionate regard for their comfort, they
will, in return, evince their gratitude. If to
protect and encourage virtue be the best preventive
from vice, then will your deserving
female servants be liberally encouraged.</p>

<p>Let your commands to your servants be
consistent and reasonable; and then mildly,
but firmly, insist on obedience to them.—“My
servants never remember what I tell them to
do,” is a complaint but too common, but
that might, in some degree, be obviated. Let
them see that you will not pass over any neglect
of orders; and when they find that this
decisive measure is accompanied with kindness
and consideration, and that you are not
to be disobeyed with impunity, they will soon
learn to remember what you command them
to do. A little effort very easily overcomes a
bad memory.</p>

<p>It is very disheartening to a poor servant
to be continually found fault with. Praise and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
reward them when you can;—human nature
will not bear constant chiding.</p>

<p>Never keep servants, however excellent they
may be in their stations, whom you know to
be guilty of immorality.</p>

<p>When servants are ill, their mistress will,
doubtless, recollect that she is their <i>patroness</i>
as well as their employer, and will not only
remit their labour, but render them all the
assistance of proper medicine, food, and comfort,
in their power.—<i>Tender assiduity is half
a cure</i>; it is a balsam to the mind, which has
a powerful effect on the body—soothes the severest
pains, and strengthens beyond the
richest cordial. The poor <i>dependent</i> creatures
may have no where to go to—no one else
to turn to; and their pale and impaired looks
will always have a claim on your sympathy.</p>

<p>As we shall have occasion to make further
remarks on the management of servants, when
treating of the business of the <i>Housekeeper</i>,
we beg leave, in order to avoid repetition, to
refer to that subject, under the head—<span class="smcap"><a href="#Housekeeper">housekeeper</a></span>.</p>

<p>“Economy,” says Mr. Cobbett, “is management.”—The
fact is, that <i>management
and regularity, is Economy verified by practice</i>;
and all persons ought to regulate their
conduct by circumstances. A moderate income,
appropriated to the expenses of housekeeping
with prudence and economy, without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
<i>parsimony</i>, but banishing <i>superfluities</i> and
<i>preventing waste</i>, may be made sufficient to
furnish every comfort in life; and, strange as
it may appear to those in affluence, an income
of from 150l. to 200l. a year, will be enough
to maintain a man and wife, with two or three
children, and a servant girl; <i>nor “beyond
that amount, need they spend one shilling per
week</i>, whatsoever may be their income.”</p>

<p>It is an excellent plan to have a set of rules
for regulating the ordinary expenses of a family,
(such as are given in the Appendix to
the <span class="smcap">practical economy</span>,) in order to check
any innovation or excess, which otherwise
might, unawares, have occurred to derange
the proposed distribution of the annual income.</p>

<p>The mistress of a family will always recollect
that, <i>in all cases</i>, the welfare and good
character of her household depends on her
own active superintendance.</p>

<p>Though habits of domestic management are
now generally precluded in the education of
young ladies of the superior class, yet, happily,
attention to family concerns is not unfrequently
found in those of less exalted rank,
whose minds, amidst the blandishments of
modern accomplishments, have been taught to
relish, as in days of yore, the more rational,
solid, and lasting pleasures, of a social and
comfortable home. And were young ladies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
early instructed in the delights of domestic
occupation, before they enter the delusive
scenes, presented by modern modes of dissipation,
we should probably find the number
of votaries to private happiness greatly
increased, and a life of domestic employment
would become the source of numberless gratifications.
In short, were they on all occasions,
when at home, under the immediate
eye of their mother, to be taught the science
of practical economy—the business of examining
and keeping accounts,—and a few other
of the leading points in the management of a
family, they would imperceptibly become competent,
and the happiest results, as to their
future conduct in life, might be most pleasingly
anticipated. Many families have owed much
of their advancement in life to the propriety of
female management.</p>

<p>One of the principal objects of the mistress
of the house is, the economy or management
of the <i>table</i>, the general display of which will
evince her judgment and taste; and this will
be shown, not so much by the profusion with
which the table is covered, as by its <i>neat and
pleasing appearance</i>, according to the present
fashion, so far as regards elegance, combined
with frugality,—the circumstances of fortune
and condition being also considered.—People
in business should not imitate the pomp and
splendour of high rank, nor should those of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
the higher circles descend to such frugal arrangements
as in them would appear to be
parsimonious.</p>

<p>The prudent manager will consider the
<i>number</i> of her guests, and consult their appetites,
rather than feast their <i>eyes</i>; thus will
she be enabled to entertain them <i>much oftener</i>,
and <i>much better</i>, at the same expense.</p>

<p>It is well understood that the mistress of a
family should have, at least, a competent
knowledge in the art of carving, not only as it
enables her to do <i>the honours of the table</i> with
propriety, but with a view to frugality also;
and if the young ladies of a family were to
practise, under the direction of their mother,
when there is no company, they would, in time,
become quite <i>au fait</i> to this graceful and elegant
accomplishment; as much practice is
required to make a good carver, even when
the theory has been previously acquired. (<i>See
Instructions for Carving</i>, under the head
<span class="smcap"><a href="#Housekeeper">housekeeper</a></span>.)</p>

<p>An esteemed writer of the present day, has
introduced to public view, a pleasing picture
of a small and well-regulated family, of which
the following is a slight sketch:—</p>

<p>“The mistress of the family is a good manager,
without any ostentatious display of it.—Elegantly
nice, without being a slave to dress
or furniture—Easy and affable with her servants,
but firm in her commands,—every one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
appearing to be contented and happy.—The
household business going on regularly, like a
good clock;—and every thing being kept in
its proper place. No scolding in the kitchen
or servants’-hall.—The table plentifully covered,
but not with incitements to luxury; the
food plain and in season, and sent up well
dressed;—with a few well chosen luxuries
introduced, when company is asked.”</p>

<p>Ladies, whose minds are framed for the
practical enjoyment of domestic comforts, will
admire and copy this beautiful picture!</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> supreme Lord of the universe has, in his
wisdom, rendered the various conditions of
mankind necessary to our individual happiness:—some
are rich, others poor—some are masters,
and others servants.—Subordination, indeed,
attaches to your rank in life, but not
<i>disgrace</i>. All men are servants in different
degrees. The nobles and ministers of state
are subservient to the king, and the king himself
is the servant of the nation, and is wisely
submissive to its laws. It manifests a divine
superintendance, that civil society should thus
be composed of <i>subordinate</i> and superior
classes. By this wise arrangement, all <i>may</i>
enjoy an equal share of real happiness, while
each possesses a due opportunity to communicate
and to receive the various benefits and
kindnesses of human life. Every wise and
good person will therefore enquire, what are
the <i>special</i> duties of his or her station; with
a steady purpose, by the assistance of God, to
discharge them faithfully; and those are the
most worthy characters who best perform the
various duties incumbent on them, <i>in that
state of life unto which it has pleased God to
call them</i>. Perhaps, there is not a more <i>useful</i>,—a
more numerous,—nor a more indispensably
necessary description of persons in society,
than those who are denominated <i>Servants</i>;
and so entirely dependent are mankind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
on each other, that it may truly be said of
<i>these</i>, in relation of the <i>social system</i>, as Pope
has said of the several parts of nature in relation
to the <i>universe</i>; that</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Young persons, on their first entering into
service, should endeavour to divest themselves
of former habits, and devote themselves to the
controul of those whom they engage to serve.
They will probably find every thing different
from what they have been accustomed to at
home, or in common life; and as their mode
of living will be greatly altered, if not wholly
changed, so must be their minds and manners.
They should endeavour to discard every low
habit and way of thinking, if such they have;
and as there will be set before them, by those
of superior rank, and cultivated understandings,
the best modes of conduct and the most
approved behaviour, they will wisely take advantage
of the opportunity which Providence
fortunately presents to them, to cultivate their
<i>minds</i> and improve their <i>principles</i>: perhaps,
the best proof they can give of their wisdom,
in this respect, is to resolve to conform with
alacrity to the duties required of them, so far
as is consistent with justice and moral government;
to be respectful and faithful to their
superiors, obliging and good-natured to their
equals, and charitable to all; as the most
grateful return they can make for the emolument,
superior comforts, and gratification they
will enjoy. They will eagerly embrace every
opportunity of learning every thing that may
be useful to themselves, and of doing any
thing that may be useful to others. Young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
persons are too apt to fancy themselves wise,
but that, generally speaking, is impossible, for
wisdom is the result of experience and reflection;
and youth must of course be almost as
much strangers to one as to the other.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> But
the instruction we are about to give, is not
intended merely for the <i>young</i> and uninitiated;—but
will be found, we trust, of great advantage
to those of <i>riper years</i>, and of some
experience; as we are never too old to learn,
and can only approach towards perfection by
regular gradations, and, as it were, step by
step:—to those of greater experience our labours
may serve as a <i>Remembrancer</i>.</p>

<p>The grand foundation of your good character
must be <i>Industry</i>, <i>fidelity</i> to your employers,
and an inviolable attachment to <i>truth</i>,
both in words and deeds. To utter a <i>falsehood</i>
to the prejudice of others, argues malice
and baseness—to <i>lie</i> in excuse of one’s self,
guilt and cowardice;—in both cases it evinces
a design to deceive, with a view to benefit
one’s self by the deceit;—besides, a liar is
always in fear of being detected, and if once
found out, he sinks into contempt, and is deservedly
divested of all credit—all confidence—and
all society.</p>

<p>But truth in speech must be accompanied
by integrity and fidelity in all your dealings;
for it is impossible for a dishonest person to
be a good servant; therefore, let no temptation
prevail on you to part with these inestimable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
jewels; nor suffer yourself even to
wish to convert the property of another to
your own use; more especially when it is
<i>confided</i> to your charge; for breach of trust
is a heinous aggravation of dishonesty.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And,
always remember, that “<i>Honesty is the best
policy</i>.” Moreover, it is not only incumbent
on you to be honest yourself, but you must
scorn to connive at the dishonesty of others.
<i>He that winks at an injury he might prevent
shares in it</i>; and it is as scandalous to fear
blame or reproach for doing your duty, as it is
to deserve reproof for the neglect of it; therefore,
should there be a confederacy among
your fellow servants to abuse the confidence
or credulity of your employer, divulge it the
very instant you perceive it, for fear your very
silence might give rise to a suspicion of your
participation in their guilt.</p>

<p>On the contrary, avoid <i>Tale-bearing</i>, for
that is a vice of a pernicious nature, and generally
turns out to the disadvantage of those
who practise it. Those who cannot help telling
<i>all</i> that they hear, will be supposed to tell
<i>more</i> than they <i>know</i>, and will, consequently,
be discredited.</p>

<p>Carefully avoid all reproachful, indecent, or
even familiar terms in speaking of your master,
mistress, or superiors; and, on the other
hand, endeavour, at all times, to vindicate
them from the open aspersions or latent insinuations
of others. There is nothing more
detestable than defamation.—Avoid it.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>
<p>To know—to be thoroughly master of your
business in the department you undertake, is
indispensably necessary; and not only to know
the several branches of your duty, both by
theory and practice, but to be determined,
from principle, to do it. In order to this, let
your whole conduct be actuated by <i>diligence</i>,
and governed by <i>temperance</i>. Banish <i>sloth</i>
and the love of ease; and, as poor Richard
says, “<i>up, and be doing</i>.”—Be ever active.—Let
your whole mind be in your business.—Think
of what you have to do—of what must
be done, and <i>do it</i>,—even before it is wanted,—and
do not wait till you are ordered to do it.
Never think any part of your business <i>too trifling</i>
to be <i>well done</i>. Consider your business
as a pleasurable amusement and you will
make it so—and,—“do not leave till to-morrow,
that which may be done to-day.”</p>

<p><i>Idleness</i> is a great source of evil, and whilst
we give way to its enjoyment, we sacrifice
both the duties and the best purposes of our
existence.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, it is not enough merely to avoid sloth,
for you must be guarded against the allurements
of pleasure—<i>Pleasure</i>, when it becomes
a business, but too frequently makes
business a torment; and as it is impossible
to attend to your duty and follow your pleasures,
the inevitable consequence must be
loss of place, disgrace, and poverty.—Not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
that you are to debar yourself from innocent
amusement, <i>at proper times</i>, and with moderation;
it is not, nor can it be expected of
you, who are to get your bread by the sweat
of your brow, that you are not to reap the harvest
of your labours; neither the laws of God
nor man exact this of you; but unlawful and
intemperate pleasures are interdicted, as alike
detrimental to your employers,—your morals,—your
character,—your health,—and your
purse.</p>

<p><i>Intemperance</i>, or excess, is a pleasurable
evil,—it smiles and seduces—enchants and
destroys. It assumes a variety of shapes, all
tending to flatter the appetite and inflame desires;—it
presents to each the allurement
to which he is most prone, and to all a pleasing
poison that impairs the body, enervates the
mind, and imperceptibly destroys all the energies
necessary to our happiness and advancement
in life.</p>

<p>Above all things, then—Be temperate.—Avoid
excess in eating and drinking—“One
expensive mouth, will wear out several pairs
of hands,”—and, “one shilling will appease the
wants of nature as effectually as a pound.”
Nor is it because you may for a time be able
to indulge those vicious habits at the expense
of others, that they are the less exceptionable.</p>

<p>The loss of health and the loss of character
are the certain consequences; and the debauch
of the evening is followed by pains and
sickness in the morning, when that which
was before poison, is administered as the
cure! Practice becomes habitual, and thus
a whole life is frequently wasted in debauchery;
poverty itself only cutting off the means, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the inclination; and the unhappy object himself,
destitute of health, character, and friends,
is left to pine and sink in misery and contempt.</p>

<p>Intemperance in <i>dress</i> is another evil that
ought to be carefully guarded against. In
most men this argues both weakness and effeminacy;
but in <i>men-servants</i> an affectation of
this kind is unpardonable—and in <i>females</i> it
opens a door to temptation and extravagance,
which but too frequently ends in ruin.</p>

<p>The virtue of <i>Silence</i> is highly commendable,
and will contribute greatly to your ease
and prosperity. Those who talk much cannot
always talk well; and many much oftener
incur censure than praise. The best proof of
wisdom is to talk little, but to hear much—Remember,
“<i>A silent tongue argues a wise
head</i>.” Never talk of yourself,—but when
others speak of themselves, listen to them;—such
attention will please them, and probably
profit yourself, as it is a chance but something
escapes them that may afford a clue to
their whole character. If it be thus dangerous
to speak much of one’s self, it is much
more so to take <i>freedoms</i> with others. A jest
may tickle, but if it hurt any one, resentment
may follow, that in some way or other may
be injurious.—Always remember to <i>hold the
secrets of the family sacred</i>, as none, not even
the least of <i>these</i>, may be divulged with impunity.</p>

<p>Quarrels are much more easily avoided than
made up; let it not, therefore, be in the
power of trifles to ruffle your temper. A
weathercock is the sport of every wind; and
a choleric man is sometimes exposed to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
scorn, at others to the resentment, and always
to the abhorrence of all around him. For
these reasons rather wink at all small injuries
than study to avenge them—“He that to destroy
a single bee that has offended him, should
throw down the hive, instead of one enemy
will have made a thousand.”</p>

<p>It is abundantly better to study the good
will of all, than to excite the resentment of any.
Make a trial, therefore, of your <i>affability</i>, and
you will find your own happiness and the goodwill
of all around you, to be the certain result.</p>

<p>We would further recommend to you to
practise <i>frugality</i>; it is a virtue which is intimately
connected with, and leads to our best
prospects in life; and if it be expedient to
any, it is more especially so to such as you,
who have, like the silk-worm, to spin your
riches out of your own bosoms. It gives you
credit with others, confidence in yourself,
and enables you to look forward with satisfaction.—In
short, it renders even the independent
man <i>doubly independent</i>. Nothing
is more true, than the old proverb, that, “<i>a
penny saved is a penny got</i>;”—nor is that saying
less true, that “<i>if you have sense to save
your pence, your pounds will take care of
themselves</i>.” If out of every shilling you get
you save something, you will soon find yourself
in the direct road to wealth.—Remember,
that the most magnificent edifice is raised
from a single stone, and every accession
thereto, however small, helps to raise the
superstructure.</p>

<p>Whilst on the important subject of frugality,
we cannot do better than to recommend
to your notice <span class="smcap">The Savings Bank</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p>These most useful and excellent establishments
are to be found in every district, and
offer, to provident and well-disposed servants,
a means of depositing small sums, in perfect
safety, for the purpose of accumulating with
interest, to be resorted to in case of illness,—any
unforeseen occurrence,—or for the purpose
of establishing themselves in some way of business
that may make them comfortable to the
end of their days. Indeed, the advantages of
savings-banks are become so well known,
that almost every one can appreciate the result
of <i>small savings</i> and prudent foresight.
It is an axiom universally admitted, that he
who rests his expectations more on his own
care and diligence, than on the aid of others,
will escape many wants and disappointments,
and enjoy many gratifications, which those
who are not possessed of this happy spirit of
prudence and independence, can never hope
to attain; and we may add, that the sufferings
of those in poverty and distress have been
but too frequently increased, by the recollection
that they might have been averted or
decreased by proper attention.</p>

<p>The encouragement which these depositories
hold out to young persons for the safe
deposit of <i>trifling</i> sums, (even so low as a
shilling,) is not unfrequently attended with the
salutary effect of inducing a perseverance in
saving, and of stimulating to habits of industry
and frugality that lead to the happiest results.
Those who adopt this plan, soon begin
to feel their independence; and this feeling
once acquired, the most pleasing consequences
inevitably follow; for he who labours for
his daily bread, and has <i>learnt to live within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
his income</i>, has learnt the <i>art of independence</i>;
and he that is <i>above want</i>, though <i>but a little</i>,
looks upon every fellow subject for his equal:
indeed, so advantageous is an early habit in
the art of <i>saving</i>, that no patrimony can be
equal to it, and it will generally be found, that
he who is sagacious enough to save a fortune,
will enjoy it infinitely better than he who inherits
it by patrimony, or has one given to
him.</p>

<p>Every savings-bank has its appointed days
and hours for transacting business, at which
times, a committee of trustees and managers
attend to pay and receive monies. Among
other advantages which these banks give, they
admit of the deposits and interest being taken
out at a very short notice, at any time, by the
depositers themselves, or by his or her executors,
administrators, or other lawful claimants.
Printed particulars of the specific terms and
regulations, may be had <i>gratis</i>, at the respective
offices.</p>

<p>The following is a sketch of the way in
which <i>money is made by saving</i>, according to
the terms of many savings-banks, established
in and near the metropolis; and there are
some (the Southwark, Limehouse, and others,)
that give interest at the rate of a halfpenny
per calendar month for every twelve shillings
deposited, which is upwards of four per cent.
per annum.</p>

<p>Again, let us admonish you, as at first, to <i>be
Industrious</i>. “Teach a man to be industrious
and you will soon make him rich.” And,
“money got by Industry, is heaven’s gift.”
Frugality and temperance, are virtues to be
practised chiefly on <i>your own account</i>, but
<i>Industry</i> is an indispensable duty that you owe
to your employers and to society. “Without frugality
few would be rich, and with it few<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
would be poor.” The man who promises
himself success without endeavours, or despairs
at the sight of difficulties, is always disappointed;
but, on the contrary, he that is
determined, and is indefatigable, succeeds
even beyond his expectation. Depend upon
it, there is not a more certain sign of a cowardly
spirit than to have the edge of one’s activity
soon blunted by opposition: on the other
hand, there is no disputing the fortitude of him
who boldly contends with obstacles, and pursues
his object till he has attained it. To men
of such temper few things are impossible. It
was an ingenious device that a man made use
of, by way of sign:—A pair of compasses,
with this motto, <i>By constancy and labour</i>;
one foot being <i>fixed</i> and the other in <i>motion</i>.—Make
this <i>your motto</i>, and you will be very
little in the power of chance or fortune.</p>

<p>What we have already said, may be considered
as addressed chiefly to <i>men</i> servants;
we have therefore to add a few admonitory
precepts, particularly appropriated to our <i>female</i>
readers.</p>

<p>One of the most advantageous qualifications
in all servants, and particularly in females, is
that of preserving a <i>good temper</i>, and endeavouring,
to the utmost of their abilities, to give
satisfaction. Possessed of a strong desire to
please, you will seldom fail of doing so. Persons
of a good disposition will be charmed with
your readiness, and those of a bad one, will be
disarmed of a great part of their harshness;
and though you may, in some instances, be
deficient in the due performance of your business,
if it be apparent that your fault proceeds
not from disobedience, indolence, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
obstinacy, great allowance will be made, and
you will rather be <i>instructed as to the future</i>
than <i>blamed</i> for the past. If you are fearful
of offending you will scarcely ever offend. In
short, <i>humility</i> is a commendable virtue, and,
combined with good temper, is the most valuable
of female qualifications, and will, infallibly,
conduct its possessors with ease and tranquillity
through life.</p>

<p><i>Cleanliness</i> is another qualification incumbent
on every female servant, and particularly
in <i>Cooks</i>, and those employed in the department
of the kitchen. These should be very
careful to keep themselves,—every place,—and
all the utensils used in cooking, perfectly clean
and neat.</p>

<p>We have already remarked, that those who
are fond of telling all that they hear, are very
naturally suspected of telling more than they
hear. The best rule is, to do your own duty
conscientiously, and leave others to take care
of theirs: by this means you will preserve
peace and acquire the love of all your fellow
servants, without offending your employers;
who, even though they may appear to give
countenance to your tale, will not in their
hearts approve of your conduct.</p>

<p>Take great care how you contract <i>new Acquaintances</i>,
for to be easily drawn into a
familiarity with strangers must be attended
with ill consequences to yourselves, and those
with whom you live. Never accept the invitations
of other servants, nor go to feast at the
expense of their masters and mistresses; as
you must, in that case, be deemed an interloper,
at least;—besides, it lays you under an
obligation to return the treat, and induces you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
after their example, to make free with the property
of your own employers, under a consciousness
of guilt, and a continual fear of
detection.</p>

<p>Give nothing away without the knowledge
and approbation of your employers, nor commit
wilful waste, for that is a crime which seldom
goes unpunished.</p>

<p>All duties are reciprocal. If you hope to
obtain favour, endeavour to deserve it. A steady
perseverance in the duties of your station is
the only sure course infallibly to promote your
progress to independence.</p>

<p>In addition to the foregoing, we should deem
ourselves guilty of the sin of omission, were
we not to insert the very excellent <i>moral hints
to female servants</i>, written by the Rev. H. G.
Watkins, in furtherance of the views of the
<span class="smcap">London Society</span>, for the improvement and
encouragement of female servants.</p>

<p>[<i>We have great pleasure in mentioning this
society, the object of which is, to promote the
moral and religious improvement of female
servants.</i></p>

<p>The society bestows <i>annual rewards</i>, on
those who are <i>duly nominated</i>, to encourage
them to view their employers as their friends,
to be correct and trust-worthy in their conduct,
and to continue as long as possible in the
same service.</p>

<p>To prevent, also, the hazard to good servants
of resorting to <i>common</i> Register Offices,
a Registry is instituted, to which—cooks, house-maids,
and nurses, wanting situations, who have
lived two years in one service—servants of all
work who have lived one year in their last
place—and young women <i>above sixteen</i>, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
have never been in service—may apply, without
any expense whatever.</p>

<p>Plans of the institution, and rules of the registry,
may be had gratis, at the society’s
house, No. 110, Hatton Garden, where attendance
is given on Mondays, Wednesdays, and
Fridays only, from ten o’clock to four.]</p>

<p>Though much of this address is applicable
to servants of both <i>sexes</i>, yet, it is for the
assistance of <i>domestic female servants</i>, that
such plain advice is here offered, as, it is hoped,
may be found useful in the direction of their
conduct, and for the promotion of their comfort.
As many servants cannot enjoy the daily
counsel of their <i>parents</i>, we endeavor to supply
their place, by entering into <i>more particulars</i>,
in the way of caution and advice, than
we otherwise should have thought it right to
do.</p>

<p>When young persons <i>first enter upon service</i>,
they should be thankful to God if they have
obtained a situation where they may be <i>instructed</i>
in those domestic duties which are to
be the business of their lives. They ought also
to be very thankful, and very submissive, to
those who will take the trouble to teach them.
Such cannot shew their gratitude in a better
way than by continuing, as long as possible,
in their <i>first</i> service. Endeavour, during this
season, to remember, by thinking often upon,
every direction you receive. This will prevent
the trouble and vexation of often repeating to
you the same thing—a circumstance which
frequently makes even good mistresses fretful,
and occasions many changes of places and
servants.—Habituate yourself, as much as possible,
to <i>every</i> kind of domestic service; it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
make you to be more generally useful, and less
likely to be long unengaged. Here may be
hinted, the great importance to your character,
of lodging, when out of place, with only <i>respectable</i>
persons. Avoid sauntering in the
street, especially in the evening, and ask your
way, not from those who are passing, but at a
shop.</p>

<p>Make it your daily study and concern in all
things to <i>maintain an unblemished character</i>.
You may then always hope to find a new
situation, if you need one, through the medium
of your last mistress, or your own <i>friends</i>; for
<i>very</i> good employers, or <i>very</i> good servants,
seldom need apply to <i>common</i> Register Offices.
It is a fact well ascertained, that many females,
totally unconscious of their danger, have been
hired from such offices, <i>as servants</i>, by keepers
of infamous houses, for no other actual purpose
than that of seduction, or prostitution!
Many decent looking, but wicked <i>women</i>, are
employed, even in the streets, to find out, and
strongly recommend, young girls to places as
servants. By this horrible deceit, many artless
females are unawares drawn into disgrace,
disease, and hasty death!</p>

<p>In your application at any time for a <i>new
service</i>, express yourself with frankness and
sincerity on every point of enquiry—Avoid
the error of requiring too high wages—many
good situations have been lost through it. Do
not undertake a service to which you are not
competent. It is no disgrace not to know
every thing; but it is dishonest to say you
can do things which are beyond your capacity.</p>

<p>It is really important to your good here and
hereafter, to stipulate for attending <i>public worship</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
once at least on every <i>Sabbath-day</i>. A
<i>good</i> mistress, who wishes to keep a good servant,
will afford <i>other</i> and better opportunities
for seeing your friends. <i>Sunday pleasures</i>, in
which there is generally a sad mixture of
company, put a young woman in the highway
of danger—and of ruin!</p>

<p>In <i>commencing</i> a new service, determine to
do your duty in it; and avoid every thing that
you found was displeasing in your former
place. Judge of your employers from your
<i>own</i> observation, and <i>their</i> behaviour to <i>you</i>,
and not from any idle reports you may hear
to their prejudice. Should you find yourself
in a reputable situation, but yet are <i>uncomfortable</i>,
through the unkind or unfeeling tempers
of your superiors, double your own diligence
and <i>civility</i>, and avoid every thing, as
much as possible, that might, however unwarrantably,
excite their suspicion. By this you
may improve their temper and conduct towards
yourself; and the very vexation they <i>have</i>
occasioned, may dispose them to make their
domestics more comfortable, and themselves
more happy.</p>

<p>Endeavour to serve with such <i>good will</i>,
readiness of mind, and attention to the <i>lawful</i>
interest and convenience of your employers,
as to render your services almost <i>necessary</i> to
them; that they may know and feel that they
are blessed, above many of their neighbours,
in having gotten a <i>good servant</i>, one who
serves, not with eye-service as a man-pleaser,
but in simplicity of heart as a Christian. You
will be sure to gain esteem by <i>cheerfully</i> doing
any lawful necessary service; though it were
not agreed for when you were hired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p>Whatever qualifications you may possess, if
you are not <i>scrupulously</i> <span class="smcap">honest</span>, you will
soon be detected—considered as worthless—and
dismissed your service. No civility or
diligence can be a recompence for dishonesty.
The more you are entrusted, the more careful
you should be to maintain the confidence reposed
in you. Avoid all <i>lotteries</i>, gaming, and
<i>secret</i> modes of spending money. Take care
that you are not deceived by the name of <i>privileges
and perquisites</i>, beyond what <i>was agreed</i>
upon.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">waste</span> of household necessaries, and the
breaking of articles through <i>carelessness</i>, are
a sort of robbery of your employer—raise bad
passions—and mostly deprive a servant of
many extra encouragements that she would
otherwise receive. These things are therefore
to be strictly guarded against. There should be
painted over every kitchen fire-place, “<span class="smcap">want
not—waste not</span>.”</p>

<p>Every employer has a right to establish <i>rules</i>
for his household; therefore, do nothing in
your master’s house, or with your mistress’s
business, that you feel obliged to conceal, <i>to
keep your situation</i>; for then, you may depend
upon it, whatever it be, it is wrong in itself,
and will bring you to harm.</p>

<p>Industry is necessary for <span class="smcap">all</span>, that they may
lead a useful life; but it is especially needful
to those who engage to <i>serve</i> others. Idleness
hath clothed many with rags. Your wages
are the yearly pay for your honesty, and your
time; therefore lying late in bed, or being
over long on errands, or making frivolous excuses
to be from home, have occasioned many
suspicions—deprived many of good places,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
and eventually of good characters. “<i>He that
is slothful in his work is brother to him that is
a great waster.</i>” Exercise due diligence as to
what are the particular duties of your station.
Make it your study to put it out of the power
of a <i>reasonable</i> mistress to find fault.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dress</span> <i>as becomes your station</i>, if you desire
to please your employers,—to avoid personal
harm, and to diminish the number and power
of <i>your</i> temptations. The happiness of society
arises from each of us keeping in our station,
and being contented with it. Among other
ways of shewing your wisdom, <i>dressing clean
and neat</i>, is of the greatest importance. By
this means, you may save a little money to
assist your relations, or yourself when unemployed,
or in time of need.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mildness</span> <i>of behaviour</i> will help you through
many difficulties. If your temper be hasty,
your duty and interest are to govern and subdue
it. Our comfort requires us to be patient
with other people, and very watchful over our
<i>own tempers</i>. “Do all things without murmuring
or disputing. A soft answer turneth
away wrath, but grievous words stir up strife.”
Mere <i>hastiness</i> of temper and of <i>tongue</i>, or the
neglect to <i>consider</i> consequences, has crowded
the gaols with malefactors,—the streets with
prostitutes,—and the workhouses with poor.</p>

<p>Young Persons, Female Servants, and others
of a similar rank in life, we more especially
address ourselves to you! You think with
horror of murder, and of prostitution; but
you perhaps little reflect, that idleness and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
self-will,—that the love of dress, and of indulgence,—that
petty acts of dishonesty,—that
misbehaviour in a place—that refusing to submit
to reproof,—that <i>rashly throwing yourselves
out of a situation in a regular family</i>,—that
wasting your money, and thus leaving
yourselves unprovided for when out of employment,—that
breaking the Sabbath, and
particularly rambling about in idle company
on the evenings of the Sabbath-day—you perhaps
little reflect that these, or any of these
evil practices, or habits, may lead you, and
that by no very long or winding path, to the
atrocious crimes which I have mentioned.
Act therefore on consideration and reason,
and not by passion. You know not how you
may irritate, and what mischief may follow.
Many a servant has lost a comfortable home,
and a mistress a useful assistant, by suffering
passion to run headlong into imprudent expressions.
<i>You</i> are more interested in retaining
a good service, than your employer in
retaining <i>you</i>; for <i>she</i> will continue to find
suitable servants, while you may be depriving
yourself, for a long time, of bread!</p>

<p>A female servant should never make <i>friendships</i>
with, or take the advice of, milk people,
butchers’ or bakers’ servants, keepers of
chandlers’ shops, green-stalls, charwomen,
&#038;c.; for mostly they seek only their own
interest and profit in every thing. If any proposal
that is new, or unexpectedly profitable, force
itself on your notice, do not act on your own
opinion, nor hastily, but, confidentially, consult
your mistress, or some relation, else you
may be as hastily ensnared to your utter undoing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<p>For want of the confidence and esteem I
allude to, there seems to be, in most families,
two <i>separate interests</i>—that of the employers,
and that of the servants.—Some servants communicate
none of their <i>personal</i> affairs to their
mistresses, and therefore mistresses are not
incited to take any special interest in <i>their</i>
future welfare. Hence, although such parties
may live a considerable time together, they are
almost strangers, and nothing like <i>friendship</i>
can take place. This is a great loss to a <i>servant</i>.
If you expect to have confidence placed
in <i>you</i>, be sincere in all your expressions, and
open, explicit, and communicative in all your
dealings.</p>

<p>In regard of your <i>fellow-servants</i>—conduct
yourselves with great <i>caution</i> towards those
whose habits are immoral and irreligious—with
<i>studied</i> discretion and <i>modesty</i> towards fellow-servants
of the other sex, and with a constant
good example before them all. This will <i>oblige</i>
them to respect you, and speak well of you:
but <i>place yourself</i> under obligation to none
of them. Do nothing that you would wish
<i>them</i> to keep secret for <i>your</i> sake. Whatever
demands secrecy, you may be sure it is wrong
for you to do, or suffer to be done. If you
connive with fellow-servants, or low tradesmen,
at any thing fraudulent, <i>you are defrauding</i>
a master or mistress, whose property you
are bound to watch and protect; and you
incur the guilt and shame of the fraud, though
you may not participate in the gain.</p>

<p>As far as you can, give good advice to your
fellow-servants, especially younger ones—read
the Bible to those who cannot, and, if you
have time, teach them to read it for themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
and pray with them, and for them. This conduct
will promote good will, and may preserve
the young and unwary from evil.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>Servants in <i>other</i> families ought not to be
told the peculiar habits and conduct of your
own employers, except it be done to their commendation;
for it may create disrespect, and
<i>can</i> do no good.</p>

<p>In all cases, one way to escape harm is to
be <i>diligent</i> and <i>useful</i>. Let others see that
you are <i>virtuous</i> from principle, and wish to
set a good example, and you will not be assailed
by the temptations of the designing and
wicked, as vain and trifling girls render themselves
liable to be.</p>

<p>Be very careful of your <i>reputation</i> for virtue
and discretion in regard of the other sex; for
it is the foundation of your happiness in this
world; and the loss of it will bring you to
misery. Avoid as much as possible going out
in the <i>evening</i>, especially on frivolous errands.
Be cautious as to whom you give your company.
“Evil communications corrupt good
manners.” Never go to <i>fairs</i>, <i>dances</i>, nor to
the theatres. Ask yourself, before you engage
in any <i>pleasuring</i> scheme—what may be the
probable end of it?</p>

<p>On all unnecessary occasions, avoid as much
as possible being alone with the other sex:
as the greatest mischiefs happen from small
circumstances. Who that is wise would risk
the loss of her virtue and happiness on mere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
<i>promises</i>, made by men of worthless character,
and which are made only to be broken? Never
trust entirely to your own fortitude—it can
only be tried by opportunity; and if, in this
case, it fail but <i>once</i>, you are undone! The
best resolve you can form is, never to give
opportunity to the tempter. A reserved modesty
is the best safeguard of virtue.</p>

<p>If a virtuous affection seems to be rising, be
sure you instantly calculate on the age and
temper, religious conduct, and probable ability
of the man to maintain a family, before you
suffer your mind to be carried away, lest your
affections run headlong, and at length are taken
advantage of, to the complete loss of your
comfort.</p>

<p><i>Servants</i>, as well as others, are under peculiar
obligation, to manifest a <span class="smcap">meek</span> and
<span class="smcap">quiet spirit</span>—to follow, in their practice,
Him who said, “I am meek and lowly in heart.” They
will, therefore, submit to a few inconveniences,
if, by so doing, they may be useful to their
fellow-servants, by shewing a Christian spirit,
and will consider daily, that <i>self-denial</i>, when
our station may require it, is the <i>duty</i> of all.</p>

<p>Our Saviour has thus commanded us:—“<i>Whatsoever
ye would that men should do
to you, do ye even so to them.</i>” This is a summary
of the law and the prophets as to our
conduct. It is a general rule, applicable in a
thousand cases to persons in every situation.
On its due observance by all the people of a
house, each toward the other, depends the
measure of comfort which may be attained in
the present state. The <i>Rule</i> is so <i>reasonable</i>,
so <i>just</i>, and so <i>useful</i>, that the neglect of it
shews the sad state of our fallen nature. Put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
yourself, for a moment, in the place of your
master, mistress, or fellow-servants; and then
judge what <i>you</i> might fairly and justly expect
from the servants in the same house. Were
<i>you</i> a mistress, you would expect all those
duties to be discharged by <i>your</i> servants, which
we recommend, and consequently, the <span class="smcap">mistress</span>,
whom you actually serve, justly expects
these things from <i>you</i>. Where this mode of
thinking and acting is adopted, it prevents
many disputes—maintains peace in the house—or
soon restores it, if, on some uncomfortable
occasion, it happens to have been lost.
None of us are without some failings. The
best of people are very far from being, at all
times, so good as they should be, therefore
<i>good</i> servants and <i>good</i> employers will endeavour
to put the best construction they can
on each others conduct; and judge of each
other rather by the <i>general behaviour</i>, than
by any particular action.</p>

<p><i>Obedience</i> is the grand duty which includes
almost every other, in the relation between
masters and mistresses, and servants. <i>Disobedience</i>
to lawful commands in a servant is dishonesty.
Act therefore with submission to the
will and judgment of your superiors. If they
require things to be done, that are contrary to
the laws of God or man, you may with meekness
decline them. If they <i>constantly</i> require
the performance of what is beyond the <i>reasonable</i>
limit of your strength, your ability,
or your time, shew your <i>obedience</i> and <i>respect</i>,
by explaining your reasons, when you signify
your intention to leave. Whatever personal
inconvenience you may feel, do not slander
your employers, either abroad or at home,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
respecting it, but apply to <i>them</i> for its removal.
Always be contented and cheerful in your
service, or respectfully retire from it. It is
very unworthy to behave improperly, or to
watch an opportunity to give warning, merely
because you hope to gain <i>higher wages</i> in the
next place. Rather respectfully ask for advance,
and if you are a good servant, and your
wish is not unreasonable, it will be granted.
Never suffer yourself to leave a family, without
leaving your best wishes for the welfare of
those whom you have served.</p>

<p>It is a more serious thing to <i>leave</i> a good situation
than many are aware of. You may
never obtain such another place, all things
considered; and may be long unsettled. “A
rolling stone gathers no moss.” A servant
that is not stationary seldom obtains <i>friends</i>
that are able and willing to assist her. You now
know <i>all</i> the inconveniences that attend your
present situation, but you cannot know whether
<i>much greater</i> may not be found in the
next you obtain. Most situations have their
advantages and disadvantages. Calculate, as
far as you can, upon both, as they are found in
the place where you <i>now</i> are. Higher wages
for another service is no proof that it would
be a <i>better</i> one, all things considered.</p>

<p>Nothing is so comfortable and <i>creditable</i> to
all parties, as when a servant lives <i>many years</i>
in the same family. Such servants never want
a <i>real</i> friend. Though you <i>may</i> perhaps obtain
a new service by a three months’ character,
you will be respected if you have lived three
years in your situation, but still more, if you
have lived seven.</p>

<p>The great master principle of all faithful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
service is an earnest desire and endeavor to
act according to the <span class="smcap">will of God</span>. The reason
why <i>servants</i> as well as others, are so defective
and partial in the discharge of their duties,
and therefore are so often uncomfortable and
distressed, is, that they are not influenced as
they ought to be, by this principle. Those,
who think of their need of God’s help, and
love him with their hearts, and minds, and
strength, <i>he</i> will love and honor. “I love
them that love me,” saith the Almighty. “They
that honor <i>me</i>, I will honor; and those who
despise me, shall be lightly esteemed.”</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p>The celebrated Dean Swift, of facetious
memory, who was a man of great genius and
talent, and had an extensive knowledge of
the world, in his <i>burlesque</i> Advice to Servants,
by holding up their faults and vices as <i>laudable
examples</i> for imitation, teaches them, in one
continued vein of sarcastic irony, what <i>they
ought not to do</i>;—we therefore transcribe a
considerable portion thereof, by way of <i>negative</i>
advice.—<i>Good servants will applaud this
artifice, and bad ones will feel its force.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When your master or lady calls a servant by name, if
the servant be not in the way, none of you are to answer,
for then there will be no end of your drudgery: and masters
themselves allow, that if a servant comes when he is called,
it is sufficient.</p>

<p>“When you have done a fault, be always pert and insolent,
and behave yourself as if you were the injured person;
this will immediately put your master or lady off their mettle.</p>

<p>“If you see your master wronged by any of your fellow-servants,
be sure to <i>conceal</i> it, for fear of being called a tell-tale:
however, there is one exception in case of a favourite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
servant, who is justly hated by the whole family; and you
are bound in prudence to lay all the faults you can upon the
favourite.</p>

<p>“The cook, the butler, the groom, the market-man, and
every other servant who is concerned in the expenses of the
family, should act as if his master’s <i>whole estate</i> ought to be
applied to that servant’s particular business. For instance,
if the cook computes his master’s estate to be a thousand
pounds a year, she reasonably concludes that a thousand
pounds a year will afford <i>meat</i> enough, and therefore, he
need not be sparing; the butler makes the same judgment,
so may the groom and the coachman; and thus every branch
of expense will be filled to your master’s <i>honour</i>.</p>

<p>“When you are chid before company, it often happens
that some stranger will have the good-nature to drop a word
in your excuse;—in such a case you will have a good title
to justify yourself, and may rightly conclude, that, whenever
he chides you afterwards, on other occasions, he may be in
the wrong; in which opinion you will be the better confirmed
by stating the case to your fellow-servants in your
own way, who will certainly decide in your favour;—therefore,
as I have said before, whenever you are chidden, complain
as if you were injured.</p>

<p>“It often happens, that servants sent on messages are apt
to stay out somewhat longer than the message requires, perhaps
two, four, six, or eight hours, or some such trifle; for
the temptation to be sure was great, and flesh and blood
cannot always resist: when you return, the master storms,
the lady scolds; stripping, cudgelling, and turning off, is the
word. But here you ought to be provided with a set of excuses,
enough to serve on all occasions: for instance, your
uncle came fourscore miles to town this morning on purpose
to see you, and goes back by break of day to-morrow:—a
brother servant that borrowed money of you when he was
out of place, was <i>running to Ireland</i>:—you were taking
leave of an old fellow-servant, who was shipping for <i>Barbadoes</i>:—your
father sent a cow to you to sell, and you
could not get a chapman for her till nine at night:—you
wrenched your foot against a stone, and were forced to stay
three hours in a shop, before you could stir a step:—a
bailiff, by mistake, seized you for a debtor, and kept you the
whole evening in a spunging house, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>“Take all tradesmen’s parts against your master; and
when you are sent to buy anything, never offer to cheapen it,
but generously pay the full demand. This is highly to your
master’s <i>honour</i>; and may be some shillings in your pocket;
and you are to consider, if your master has paid too much,
he can better afford the loss than a poor tradesman.</p>

<p>“Never submit to stir a finger in any business, but that for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
which you were particularly hired. For example, if the
groom be drunk, or absent, and the butler be ordered to shut
the stable-door, the answer is ready, An’t please your honour,
I don’t understand <i>horses</i>. If a corner of the hangings wants
a single nail to fasten it, and the footman be directed to tack
it up, he may say, he doth not understand that sort of work,
but his honour may send for the upholsterer.</p>

<p>“Masters and ladies are usually quarrelling with the servants
for not shutting the doors after them: for neither masters
nor ladies consider, that those doors must be open before
they can be shut, and the labour is double to open and shut
them; therefore the best, the shortest, and the easiest way is
to do <i>neither</i>. But if you are so often teazed to shut the
door, that you cannot easily forget; then give the door such
a clap as you go out, as will shake the whole room, and
make every thing rattle in it, to put your master and lady in
mind that you observe their directions.</p>

<p>“If you find yourself to grow in favour with your master
or lady, take some opportunity in a very mild way to give
them warning; and when they ask the reason, and seem loth
to part with you, answer that you would rather live with
them than any body else, but a poor servant is not to be
blamed if he strives to better himself;—that service is no
inheritance,—that your work is great, and your wages very
small. Upon which, if your master hath any generosity, he
will add five or ten shillings a quarter rather than let you
go: but if you are baulked, and have no mind to go off, get
some fellow-servant to tell your master, that he hath prevailed
upon you to stay.</p>

<p>“Whatever <i>tid bits</i> you can <i>pilfer</i> in the day, save them to
juncket with your fellow-servants at night, and take in the
<i>butler</i>, provided he will give you <i>drink</i>.</p>

<p>“Write your own name, and your sweet-heart’s, with the
smoke of a candle, on the ceiling of the kitchen, or the
servants’-hall, to shew your learning.</p>

<p>“If you are a young sightly fellow, whenever you whisper
your young mistress at tea-table, run your nose full in her
cheek; or, if your breath be good, breath full in her face;
this I have known to have had very good consequences in
some families.</p>

<p>“Never come till you have been called three or four
times, for none but <i>dogs</i> will come at the first whistle: and
when the master calls, <i>Who’s there?</i> no servant is bound to
come; for <i>Who’s there</i> is nobody’s name.</p>

<p>“When you have broken all your earthen drinking-vessels
below stairs (which is usually done in a week), the copper
pot will do as well; it can boil milk, heat porridge, hold
small beer, or, in case of necessity, serve other purposes;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
therefore apply it indifferently to all these uses; but never
wash or scour it, for fear of taking off the tin.</p>

<p>“Let it be a constant rule, that no chair, stool, or table, in
the servants’-hall, or the kitchen, shall have above three legs,
which hath been the ancient and constant practice in all the
families I ever knew, and is said to be founded upon two reasons;
first, to shew that servants are ever in a <i>tottering</i> condition;
secondly, it was thought a point of <i>humility</i>, that the
servants’ chairs and tables should have at least one leg fewer
than those of their masters. I grant there hath been an exception
to this rule with regard to the cook, who by old
custom was allowed an easy chair to <i>sleep</i> in after dinner;
and yet I have seldom seen them with above three legs.
Now this epidemical lameness of servants’ chairs is by philosophers
imputed to two causes, which are observed to make
the greatest revolutions in states and empires; I mean, <i>love
and war</i>. A stool, a chair, or a table, is the first weapon
taken up in a general romping or skirmish; and after a
peace, the chairs are apt to suffer in the conduct of <i>an amour</i>,
the cook being usually fat and heavy, and the butler a little
in drink.</p>

<p>“When you stop to tattle with some crony servant, in the
same street, leave your own street-door <i>open</i>, that you may
get in without knocking when you come back; otherwise
your mistress may know you are gone out, and you may be
chidden.</p>

<p>“I do most earnestly exhort you all to unanimity and
concord: but mistake me not: you may quarrel with each
other as much as you please; only always bear in mind, that
you have a <i>common enemy</i>, which is your master and lady,
and you have a common cause to defend. Believe an old
practitioner; whoever, out of malice to a fellow-servant,
carries a tale to his master, will be ruined by a general
confederacy against him.</p>

<p>“The general place for rendezvous for all the servants,
both in winter and summer, is the kitchen: there the grand
affairs of the family ought to be consulted; whether they
concern the stable, the dairy, the pantry, the laundry, the
cellar, the nursery, the dining-room, or my lady’s chamber:
there, as in your own proper element, you can laugh, and
squall, and romp in full security.</p>

<p>“When any servant comes home drunk, and cannot appear,
you must all join in telling your master, that he is
gone to bed very sick; upon which your lady will be so
good-natured as to order some comfortable thing for the poor
man, or maid.</p>

<p>“When your master and lady go abroad together, to dinner,
or on a visit for the evening, you need leave <i>only one</i>
servant in the house, or even one black-guard boy to answer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
at the door, and attend the children, if there be any. Who
is to stay at home is to be determined by long and short
cuts; and the stayer at home may be comforted by a visit
from a sweet-heart, without danger of being caught together.
These opportunities must <i>never</i> be missed, because they
come but seldom, and all is safe enough while there is a
servant in the house.</p>

<p>“When your master or lady comes home, and wants a
servant who happens to be abroad, your answer must be,
that he had but just that minute stept out, being sent for by a
cousin who was dying.</p>

<p>“If your master calls you by name, and you happen to
answer at the fourth call, you need not hurry yourself;
and if you be chidden for staying, you may lawfully say,
you came no sooner, because you did not know <i>what</i> you
were called for.</p>

<p>“When you are chidden for a fault, as you go out of the
room, and down stairs, <i>mutter</i> loud enough to be plainly
heard; this will make him believe you are innocent.</p>

<p>“Whoever comes to visit your master or lady when they
are abroad, <i>never</i> burthen your memory with the person’s
name; for, indeed, you have too many other things to remember.
Besides, it is a porter’s business, and your master’s
fault he does not keep one; and who can remember names?
and you will certainly mistake them; as you can neither
write nor read.</p>

<p>“If it be possible, never tell a lie to your master or lady,
<i>unless</i> you have some hopes that they cannot find it out in
less than half an hour. When a servant is turned off, all
his faults must be told, although most of them were never
known by his master or lady; and all mischiefs done by
others, charged to him. [Instance them.] And when they
ask any of you, why you never acquainted them before? the
answer is, Sir, or Madam, really I was afraid it would
make you angry; and besides, perhaps, you might think
it was malice in me. Where there are little masters and
misses in a house, they are usually great impediments to the
diversions of the servants; the only remedy is to bribe them
with <i>goody goodies</i>, that they may not tell tales to papa and
mamma.</p>

<p>“I advise you of the servants, whose master lives in the
country, and who expect vales, always to stand rank and file
when a stranger is taking his leave, so that he must of necessity
pass between you; and he must have more confidence
or less money than usual if any of you let him <i>escape</i>;
and according as he behaves himself, remember to treat him
the <i>next time</i> he comes.</p>

<p>“If you are sent with ready money to buy any thing at
a shop and happen at that time to be out of cash, <i>sink the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
money</i>, and take up the goods on your master’s account.
This is for the <i>honour</i> of your master and yourself; for he
becomes a man of credit at your recommendation.</p>

<p>“When your lady sends for you up to her chamber to
give you any orders, be sure to stand at the door, and keep
it open, fiddling with the lock all the while she is talking
to you; and keep the handle in your hand, for fear you
should forget to shut the door after you.</p>

<p>“If your master or lady happen once in their lives to accuse
you wrongfully, you are a <i>happy</i> servant; for you have
nothing more to do, than, for <i>every</i> fault you commit while
you are in their service, to put them in mind of that false
accusation, and protest yourself equally innocent in the present
case.</p>

<p>“When you have a mind to leave your master, and are
too bashful to break the matter for fear of offending him,
the best way is to grow rude and saucy of a sudden, and beyond
your usual behaviour, till he finds it necessary to turn
you off; and when you are gone, to <i>revenge</i> yourself, give
him and his lady <i>such</i> a character to all your brother-servants
who are out of place, that <i>none</i> will venture to offer their
service.</p>

<p>“Some nice ladies, who are afraid of catching cold, having
observed that the maids and fellows below stairs often
forget to shut the doors after them, as they come in, or go
out into the back yards, have contrived that a pulley and a
rope, with a large piece of lead at the end, should be so
fixt, as to make the door shut of itself, and require a strong
hand to open it, which is an immense toil to servants, whose
business may force them to go in and out fifty times in a
morning: but <i>ingenuity</i> can do much, for prudent servants
have found out an effectual remedy against this insupportable
grievance, by <i>tying up</i> the pulley in such a manner, that
the weight of lead shall have no effect; however, as to
my own part, I would rather chuse to keep the door <i>always
open</i>, by laying a heavy stone at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>“The servants’ candlesticks are generally broken, for
nothing can last for ever. But you may find out many expedients;
you may conveniently stick your candle in a bottle,
or with a lump of butter against the wainscot, in a powder-horn,
or in an old shoe, or in a cleft stick, or in the barrel
of a pistol, or upon its own grease on a table, in a coffee-cup,
or a drinking-glass, a horn-can, a tea-pot, a twisted
napkin, a mustard-pot, an ink-horn, a marrow-bone, a
piece of dough, or you may cut a hole in the loaf, and
stick it there.</p>

<p>“When you invite the neighbouring servants to junket
with you at home in an evening, teach them a peculiar way
of tapping or scraping at the kitchen-window, which you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
may hear, but not your master or lady, whom you must
take care not to disturb or frighten at such unseasonable
hours.</p>

<p>“Lay all faults upon a lap-dog, or favourite cat, a monkey,
parrot, a child; or on the servant who was last turned off:
by this rule you will excuse yourself, do no hurt to any
body else, and save your master or lady from the trouble and
vexation of chiding.</p>

<p>“When you want proper instruments for any work you
are about, use all expedients you can invent, rather than
leave your work undone. For instance, if the poker be
out of the way, or broken, stir the fire with the tongs; if
the tongs be not at hand, use the muzzle of the <i>bellows</i>, the
wrong end of the fire-shovel, the handle of the fire-brush,
the end of a mop, or your master’s cane. If you want paper
to singe a fowl, <i>tear</i> the first book you see about the house.
Wipe your shoes, for want of a clout, with the bottom of
a curtain, or a damask napkin. Strip off your livery lace
for garters. If the butler wants a jordan, he may use the
great silver cup.</p>

<p>“There are several ways of putting out candles, and you
ought to be instructed in them all: you may run the candle-end
against the wainscot, which puts the snuff out immediately:
you may lay it on the ground, and tread the snuff
out with your foot: you may hold it upside down, until it
is choaked with its own grease; or cram it into the socket
of the candlestick: you may whirl it round in your hand
till it goes out: you may spit on your finger and thumb,
and pinch the snuff till it goes out. The cook may run the
candle’s nose into the meal-tub, or the groom into a vessel
of oats, or a lock of hay, or a heap of litter: the house-maid
may put her candle out by running it against a looking-glass,
which nothing cleans so well as candle-snuff:
but the quickest and best of all methods is, to blow it out
with your breath, which leaves the candle clear, and readier
to be lighted.</p>

<p>“There is nothing so pernicious in a family as a tell-tale,
against whom it must be the principal business of you <i>all</i> to
unite: whatever office he serves in, take all opportunities
to spoil the business he is about, and to cross him in every
thing. For instance, if the butler be a tell-tale, break his
glasses whenever he leaves the pantry door open; or lock
the cat or the mastiff in it, who will do as well: mislay a
fork or a spoon, so as he may never find it. If it be the
cook, whenever she turns her back, throw a lump of soot
or a handful of salt in the pot, or smoking coals into the
dripping-pan, or daub the roast meat with the back of the
chimney, or hide the key of the jack. If a footman be suspected,
let the cook daub the back of his new livery; or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
when he is going up with a dish of soup, let her follow him
softly with a ladle-full, and dribble it all the way up stairs
to the dining-room; and then let the house-maid make such
a noise, that her lady may hear it. The waiting-maid is very
likely to be guilty of this fault, in hopes to ingratiate herself:
in this case, the laundress must be sure to tear her shifts
in the washing, and yet wash them but half; and, when she
complains, tell all the house that she sweats so much, and
her flesh is so nasty, that she fouls a shift more in one hour,
than the kitchen-maid doth in a week.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> it is obvious that a good education
can be no impediment to domestic management,
but may be of material assistance in
the furtherance of family comforts, yet it is
pleasing to reflect that many of the essential
duties of life are within the reach of less
exalted attainments; and that the woman who
has been reared in useful pursuits, and whose
chief aim is to perform the social obligations,
will seldom fail of acquitting herself with
credit and satisfaction, and especially if accompanied
with that well-directed ductility
of mind which bends its attention to the lesser
objects of life, and is frequently found to be
essential in the management of a family.</p>

<p>A housekeeper possessed of such facilities,
as a ground-work for other qualifications,
must be a desirable acquisition in a family
where the mistress is of rank and consideration,
and feels herself superior to the management
of her own household affairs. Indeed,
the situation of a housekeeper, in almost
every family, is of great importance.—She
superintends nearly the whole of the domestic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
establishment,—has generally the controul and
direction of the servants, particularly of the
female servants—has the care of the household
furniture and linen—of all the grocery—dried
and other fruits, spices, condiments, soap,
candles, and stores of all kinds, for culinary
and other domestic uses. She makes all the
pickles, preserves, and sometimes the best
pastry—She generally distils and prepares all
the compound and simple waters, and spirits,
essential and other oils, perfumery, cosmetics,
and similar articles that are prepared at home,
for domestic purposes. In short, she is the
<i>locum tenens</i>, the <i>Lady Bountiful</i>, and the
active representative of the mistress of the family;
and is expected to do, or to see done,
every thing that appertains to the good and orderly
management of the household.</p>

<p>She ought to be a steady middle-aged woman,
of great experience in her profession,
and a tolerable knowledge of the world.—In
her conduct, she should be moral, exemplary,
and assiduous, as the harmony, comfort, and
economy of the family will greatly depend on
her example; and she must know, that no occurrence
can be too trifling for her attention,
that may lead to these results, and whereby
waste and unnecessary expense may be avoided.</p>

<p>When the entire management of the servants
is deputed to her, her situation becomes
the more arduous and important. She will
invite and excite their integrity, frugality, and
assiduity, by her own liberal conduct towards
them, and will shew them, that “<i>according to
their pains will be their gains</i>.” Thus will she
give encouragement to merit, ensure to herself
respectful attention, inspire zeal, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
exact a grateful return from all whose dispositions
are tractable; she will also find such
conduct tend much to her own comfort, and
greatly to promote the interest of her principals.
She will never discharge a good servant
for a slight offence; but will remember, that
“<i>to bear and to forbear is the great art of living</i>.”
She will endeavour to govern with
<i>suavity</i> and <i>mildness</i>; ever stimulating to
good conduct, by <i>admonition</i> or <i>praise</i>, when
deserved, rather than seeking by <i>threats</i> or
harsh measures to correct trifling faults or
inadvertencies;—imposing no commands that
are unreasonable, nor reproving but with
<i>justice</i> and <i>temper</i>. If servants have hardships
to undergo, she will let them see, that she
feels for the necessity of urging them. To
cherish the desire of pleasing in them, she
will convince them, that they may succeed in
their endeavours to please her. Human nature
is the same in all stations. Convince the servants
that you have a considerate regard for
their comforts, and they will be found to be
grateful, and to reward your attention by their
own assiduity: besides, nothing is so endearing
as being courteous to our inferiors. A
most excellent maxim is,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry small">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Be to their faults a <i>little blind</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And to their <i>virtues very kind</i>.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>By these, and similar means, <i>bad</i> servants may
be converted into <i>good ones</i>, and the whole
household rendered comfortable and happy.</p>

<p>The prudent housekeeper will carefully avoid
all approaches to familiarity; as that destroys
subordination, and ultimately induces contempt;
and then, “Her occupation’s gone.”
When servants are indisposed, she will best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
consult the feelings of her superiors, as well
as her own, by remitting their labours, paying
them attention, giving them advice, and
the assistance of suitable food and comfort.
<i>Tenderness and assiduity</i>, in such cases, have
great effect;—and in the language of humanity,
<i>is half a cure</i>.</p>

<p>Female servants who would pursue an honest
course, have numberless difficulties to contend
with, and should, therefore, be treated kindly.
The housekeeper in a great family, has ample
means of doing good; and she will, doubtless,
recollect that it is a part of her duty to protect
and encourage virtue, as the best preventive
from vice.</p>

<p>It behoves every servant to maintain a good
character, nor ought it to be refused when due.—Servants
have nothing to depend on but
their good name, which it would be the height
of injustice wantonly to deprive them of.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It
ought to be made a point, by all persons hiring
servants, most scrupulously to enquire
into their characters, from their last places.—To
refuse countenance to the bad, and to
encourage the good servant, are indispensable
duties which we owe to society.</p>

<p>In families where there is a house-steward,
the marketing will be done, and the tradesmen’s
bills will be collected, examined, and
discharged, by him; but in many families, the
business of marketing, and of keeping the accounts,
devolves on the housekeeper. It is,
therefore, incumbent on her to be well informed
of the prices and qualities of all articles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
of household consumption in general use;
and of the best times and seasons for procuring
them, in order that by comparing
prices and qualities, she may be able to substitute
those that are most reasonable, but
equally to her purpose, and best attainable, for
others that are more costly or more scarce.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Before the housekeeper goes to market, she
will look over the larder with the cook, especially
when company is expected, and on a
Saturday, and consider well what things are
wanted, not forgetting even the smaller articles,
that so there may be no necessity for
sending out in a hurry, or on a Sunday, for
any thing.</p>

<p>The best and most economical way possible
for marketing, is to pay <i>ready money</i> for
all that you can, especially for miscellaneous
articles, and to deal for the rest with the most
respectable tradesmen, whose bills should be
settled weekly, or, at any rate, frequently, to
prevent mistakes; without these precautions,
even those of much experience, may chance to
be cheated by unprincipled strangers, with old
poultry—stale fish—tough mutton—or cow
beef.—It should always be recollected, that
without good provisions the skill of the cook
will avail nothing.</p>

<p>But, by whomsoever the provisions may be
bought, it behoves the housekeeper to examine
them as they come in,—to see that in weight
and measure they agree with the tickets sent
with them,—and to make the necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
arrangements, in conjunction with the cook, for
their due appropriation.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Besides being a good market-woman, the
housekeeper ought to be ready at figures, and
to understand the nature of common accounts,
as it will generally be her business to keep
the detailed accounts of the family, to examine
the tradesmen’s bills by the checks, to
pay them, and pay for all miscellaneous articles
as they are brought in, for which vouchers
must be given, to be produced when the account
is settled; and to avoid the possibility
of mistake, this should be done weekly, or at
short and stated periods; for this purpose,
a book must be kept, in which entry should
immediately be made, of all monies paid,
and in the evening, the book should be cast
up, and compared with the cash in hand, by
which means, any omission that might have
taken place in the course of the day may easily
be recollected and set right, and the account
will be ready for inspection when called for.</p>

<p>The elegant and tasteful arrangement of the
table is a very essential object in every Establishment;
and when that department devolves
on the housekeeper, will require her
very serious consideration; as much of the
credit and respectability of the family will depend
on her.—Economy, taste, and tact must
necessarily be displayed, and its execution
involves much judgment, great attention, and
unceasing assiduity. In order to have a table
well served, and tastefully arranged, the skill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
and ingenuity of the cook, as well as the housekeeper,
will be required—of the cook to dress
it according to the <i>fashion</i>, and of the housekeeper,
afterwards, to see that it be dished
and served up according to the present <i>costume</i>.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The etiquette of the table being arranged
by the <i>bill of fare</i>, previously made out, and
the dishes laid in order below stairs; it is the
province of the housekeeper, when dinner is
served up, to see that the butler has placed
them properly on the table above; this requires
a quick glance of the eye, and a correct
taste to measure distances,—and to see that the
dishes accord with each other, and thereby
form a pleasing, inviting, and well-grouped
picture.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The housekeeper will employ the little leisure
time she may have before the servants’ dinner
hour, which in most families is generally early,
in preparing the best pastry, or in doing any
other things she can assist in, preparatory to
the family dinner; at any rate, she will look
around and see that the household business
is, every where, going on regularly, and the
culinary preparations getting forward. She
then takes her seat at the head of the table, in
the steward’s, or her own room, with the
principal female servants and the men not in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
livery. In this situation she will have to carve,
and as she will occasionally be required to
assist the cook in dissecting a dish to be sent
up stairs, it is indispensably necessary that she
be proficient in the art of carving: and besides,
to carve meat well, is a great saving.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It
would argue prudence and economy in her,
to see that the pieces of bread which are
brought down stairs, be eaten at this table,
or in the servants’-hall, and it would be extravagance
to suffer <i>new</i> bread to be eaten below
stairs.</p>

<p>When the dinner is gone up, her attention
will be directed to the <i>dessert</i>, which she prepares
and lays out in her own room, previous
to the removal of the cloth above stairs;
when she makes her appearance with it, and
arranges it on the dining-room table.</p>

<p>The Housekeeper now begins to find herself
at leisure; by this time too, the maids
will have done the principal part of their work
above stairs, and the cook, kitchen-maid, and
scullion, have washed up, and cleared away
every thing, and cleaned up the kitchen.—After
tea, the provident housekeeper will begin to
think about <i>to-morrow</i>; evening being the
best time for preparing all things that are likely
to be wanted soon.—Small quantities of spices
should be pounded and ground, and laid by
in bottles, well corked, ready for use.—Much
less spices are necessary, in gravies, &amp;c. when
thus prepared, than when boiled whole.—Raisins
may be stoned, if wanted next day.—Currants
may be washed, picked, and perfectly
dried. White sugars should be broken,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
or pounded, rolled with a bottle, and sifted.
Some of the oranges and lemons, to be used
for juice, should be pared, and the rind put by
to dry; and of some, when squeezed, and the
pulp scraped out, the rinds may be kept dry
for grating.</p>

<p>[The Salary of the Housekeeper is from
twenty-five to fifty guineas per annum, dependent
on the extent of the family, and the
nature of the business she undertakes.]</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Useful Memorandums.</i></p>

<p>Provisions that will keep, should be laid
in in quantities when cheapest, to be ready
when wanted.—The best of all kinds are the
most economical, not only because they <i>are
best</i>, but also, because they go furthest.</p>

<p>As sugar is an article of considerable expense,
it is to be understood that, of the <i>white</i>
sugars, the most refined goes furthest and
sweetens best. Chuse those that are close,
heavy, and shining.—The best sorts of the
<i>brown</i> have a bright gravelly look. The coarser
sorts are strongest and fittest for wines, sweetmeats,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>The only certain road to regularity, is to do
every thing in its proper time—keep every
thing in its proper place—and apply every
thing to its proper use.</p>

<p>The great Dutch statesman, De Witt, attributed
the whole art of dispatching a multitude
of business, to the <i>doing of one thing
at a time</i>.</p>

<p>The want of regularity gives to families the
appearance of chance and confusion; on the
contrary, order in a family is productive of
much happiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span></p>

<p>Accustom all the servants under your direction
to <i>rise early</i>, and let them breakfast at an
early hour. If orders be given betimes in the
morning, there will be more time to execute
them,—servants will perform their work with
more ease,—and less hands will be required.
If the economy of time were duly considered,
and a regular plan of daily employment laid
down, much business may be effected without
hurry or fatigue.</p>

<p>As some preparation is necessary in all
families for accidental visitors, care should be
taken to have things in readiness for lunch,
chocolate, sandwiches, &amp;c.</p>

<p>An inventory of furniture, linen, china,
plate, &amp;c. should be kept, and the articles
examined by it twice a year, at least, or oftener
if the servants be changed, and a correct
list of the articles delivered into the care of
the new servants should be kept.—House-cloths,
knife-cloths, &amp;c. should be numbered,
and always be accounted for, either whole or
in part—which would be done if a note were
inserted at the top of the list of the articles
delivered out.</p>

<p>Tin fenders, and other things that are painted,
should be painted every year or two.—Tin
vessels, if suffered to become damp, soon
rust, and are eaten into holes.</p>

<p>The best way to scald fruits or to boil vinegar
is, to put it in a stone jar on an iron hearth—or
to put the jar in a saucepan of boiling water,
called a <i>water bath</i>.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold">THE STORE-ROOM AND STILL-ROOM.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> rooms are entirely under the management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
of the housekeeper. The <span class="smcap">store-room</span>
is appropriated as a depository for such imperishable
articles of household consumption
as are in continual request, and may be laid
up, when purchased in quantities,—at times
when cheapest,—most in season, or best—to
be ready at hand when wanted.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 150%;">☞</span> Let every thing, not only here, but all
over the house, be kept in its <i>proper place</i>,
applied to its <i>proper use</i>, and <i>replaced</i> when
worn out or destroyed.</p>

<p><i>N. B. To save the trouble of referring to
different places, for the several methods of
storing or preserving many articles which are
proper to be kept, we shall insert under this
head every thing of this description that may
occur to us.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soap</span> will be the better for keeping—indeed,
it should not be used when newly made. The
cakes should be cut with a wire or string, into
oblong squares, and laid up, on a dry shelf, a
little distance apart, and across each other, so
as to admit the air betwixt them, to harden it.—This
method will save one third. <i>Note</i>,—If
dried fast, soap will crack and break when
wetted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Candles</span> and <span class="smcap">soap</span> made in cold weather,
are best; and when the price of these articles
are likely to be high, a reasonable stock of
both should be laid in.—Candles, if kept packed
in a chest, will be the better for keeping eight
or ten months, and may be kept well, if necessary,
for two years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Starch</span> should be bought when flour is
cheap, and may be kept in a dry warm place,
if closely covered, as long as may be necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loaf Sugars</span> should be kept tied up in
paper, and hung up in a dry place. Brown
sugars should be kept covered up, and in a
moderately dry place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sweetmeats</span>, <span class="smcap">Preserves</span>, &amp;c. must be carefully
kept from the air, and in a very dry place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teas</span>, <span class="smcap">Coffee</span>, <span class="smcap">Chocolate</span>, <span class="smcap">Dried fruits</span>,
and generally, all kinds of Grocery and Condiments
require to be kept dry and free from
air.</p>

<p>The various kinds of <span class="smcap">seeds</span> and <span class="smcap">rice</span>, <span class="smcap">pearl-barley</span>,
<span class="smcap">oatmeal</span>, &amp;c. must be kept in a dry
place, and be <i>covered close</i>, to preserve them
from insects.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bread</span> is best kept in an earthern pan with
a cover. A loaf should not be cut till it is a
day old. The bread that is cut unnecessarily
in the parlour, should be eaten at the second
table before more is cut.</p>

<p>Writing and other papers, that are constantly
wanted, should be bought by the ream
or bundle, and kept in a dry place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Apples</span> should be spread, separately, on
clean dry straw, on a dry upper floor, and
care must be taken to preserve them from
frost.—The Americans throw a clean canvas
cloth over them, which will answer the purpose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pears</span> should be hung up, singly, by the stalk
in a dry place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grapes</span> should be gathered before they are
ripe, and may also be preserved hung up in
single bunches the same way;—or they may
be kept in saw-dust, in boxes with covers, to
exclude the air—Every bunch being laid apart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oranges</span> and <span class="smcap">Lemons</span>, if bought when
cheapest, may be preserved a long time,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
packed in fine, dried sand, with their stems
upwards, and kept from the influence of the
air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fresh Meat</span>, <span class="smcap">Poultry</span>, <span class="smcap">Fish</span>, &amp;c. should be
kept in a cool, airy place.</p>

<p>All <span class="smcap">salted</span> and <span class="smcap">dried meats</span>, hams, tongues,
&amp;c. should be tied up in strong paper, and
must be kept in a cold, dry place, (not in the
kitchen) else they will become musty and
rancid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Green Vegetables</span> should be kept on a
damp stone floor, and excluded from the air
by a damp cloth thrown over them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carrots</span>, <span class="smcap">Parsnips</span>, and <span class="smcap">Beet-roots</span>, must
be kept in layers of dry sand for winter use.
Neither these nor potatoes should be washed
till wanted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Potatoes</span> must be carefully covered, to protect
them from frost, in winter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Onions</span> should be tied in traces, and hung
up in a cold dry place. If the root of each
onion be seared, it can never grow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parsley</span> should be cut close to the root,
and dried in a warm room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Truffles</span>, <span class="smcap">Morels</span>, &amp;c. must be kept in
bags in a dry place.</p>

<p>A bag should be kept to save all the waste
rags; this will not only be economical, but
will prevent litter.</p>

<p class="noindent center p2 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE ART OF CARVING.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p>The art of carving is an useful and elegant accomplishment;
and, according to the fashion of the
present day, cannot be too well understood by the
<i>Heads of Families</i>. It may best be acquired by
observation and practice; and to <i>Young Ladies</i>
who can attend to the example of their parents, the
following plain and familiar instructions may not be
unacceptable.—A previous knowledge of the conformation
of the several parts, and the peculiar
nature of the article to be carved, will, with due
attention, render the business easy, and it would
be still more so, if the loins, breasts, and necks of
mutton, lamb, and veal, were to be <i>properly jointed</i>
and divided, before they are sent home.</p>

<p>The master and mistress of the family, who do
<i>The honours of the table</i>, when dinner is announced,
will see, of course, that the upper places are taken
by the married ladies of the highest quality that are
then present; the dowagers or widows next, and
lastly, the unmarried ladies; all, nearly according
to their respective ages. The gentlemen will be
seated according to the same etiquette, which is
perfectly understood by the fashionable world.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beef.</span>—<i>The Surloin.</i> This joint is brought to
table with the skin side upwards—Cut off the outside,
in the direction of the ribs, quite down to the
bone, and take off slice after slice of a moderate
thickness, in the same direction.—Or, you may cut
through the middle of the sirloin. Give a little of
the soft fat with each slice, which will be found covering
the roll, on the inside. Give also, a little of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the roll, when preferred, as it is short-grained and
tender. To get at this and the fat, turn the joint
up, upon the chine-bone, and cut it across the ribs.</p>

<p><i>The Ribs</i> are to be carved exactly in the same
way.</p>

<p><i>The Edge-bone</i> or <i>isch (hip)</i> bone. Cut off a
<i>thick</i> outside slice from the upper surface, the whole
length, horizontally, and follow the cut. The delicious
soft fat, resembling marrow, will be found
at the back of the bone, and the hard fat may be
taken, in thin, horizontal slices, from the edge of
the joint. The upper part of this joint is the richest
and best.</p>

<p><i>The Buttock</i> is to be carved in the same way.</p>

<p><i>The Breast-cut.</i>—Cut off thin slices, either parallel
with the ribs, or across. The fat on the upper
side is firm and gristly, that on the under side
soft, and more delicate; therefore offer that which is
best liked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Veal.</span>—<i>The Fillet.</i> This is the joint similar to a
round of beef. Cut off a slice from the upper surface,
evenly, as from a round or edge-bone of beef,
and this outside is often preferred. The next slices
should be cut thin and smoothly. With every slice
give a little fat, and some of the stuffing, which lies
under the flap.</p>

<p><i>The Breast.</i> Separate the ribs from the brisket,
across, where the bones are broken, and again, the
gristly part of the breast-cut from the ribs, in the
same direction. Give some of the gristly part, with a
bone of the ribs or neck, and a little of the sweetbread,
cut across the middle, to each person.</p>

<p><i>The Calf’s-head.</i> Every part of this joint is rich
and delicious. Cut it lengthwise, from the nose to
the neck, passing the knife through the flesh under
the eye, quite to the bone, all the way. The throat
sweetbread lies in the thick part of the neck end,
and delicious short slices of it may be taken off
from the lower side, crosswise, to be given with the
former. The eye is esteemed a great delicacy and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
may be taken out with the point of a knife, and
divided into two parts. Some fine lean will be found
under the jaw-bone, when taken off, and the palate
in the lower or under part of the head is deemed a
dainty. Both sides of the head are to be carved
alike. A part of the tongue and brains, which are
usually served up in a separate dish, with egg sauce,
must be given to each person.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mutton.</span>—<i>The Shoulder.</i> This joint should be
sent to table with the back upwards, and with
paper twisted round the shank. When properly
roasted, it is very full of gravy, and has many nice
parts. The first cut should be made in the thin,
hollow part, and several slices may be taken thence.
When that is all cut away, some fine slices may
be taken from both sides of the ridge of the blade-bone,
cutting straight up the back from the thick
end towards the shank. The under side affords several
nice cuts of fat and lean intermixed, and is full
of gravy. Some prefer the jelly part near the
knuckle;—the lean on the under side of the blade-bone,
is the most tender. The fat lies in the round
prominent part or flap, opposite the hollow part of
the shoulder, which is cut lengthwise and a thin bit
of this should be given to each person.—A shoulder
of mutton <i>over</i> roasted is <i>spoiled</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Leg.</i> When boiled, it should be served up
lying on its back; but when roasted, with the back
upwards. Cut into the hollow part a little distant
from the knuckle, through the pope’s-eye, quite
to the bone, and take out thin deep slices towards
the thickest part. The back of the leg affords some
nice slices at the thick end, which must be cut out
the long way of the joint.—Slices of fat may also
be taken from the under side, or back part of the
leg, in the same direction. Some prefer the knuckle
part, which, though dry, is full of jelly and very
nutricious. The cramp-bone forms a slight prominence
at the back of the leg, near the shank, and
may be cut out by passing the knife round it. As<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
this is a heavy joint, some writing paper should
be wrapped round the shank, to enable the carver
the better to turn it up, with his left hand.</p>

<p><i>The Haunch</i>, is to be carved in the same manner
as venison.</p>

<p><i>The Saddle</i>, is the two loins together. Cut out
long thin slices on each side of the chine-bone, from
the tail to the end. If any person like a part of
the tail, it may be readily divided, the joints being
about an inch apart. Rich gravy is found in the cut
along the chine-bone, where the incision has been
made.</p>

<p><i>The Loin</i> may be carved the same way; or it
may be cut the other way, in the direction of the
bones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lamb.</span>—<i>The Fore-quarter.</i> Separate the shoulder
from the ribs or breast, (by some called the crust
or scoven,) taking care not to leave the bones bare.
Then squeeze half a lemon or Seville orange, rub a
slice of butter, and sprinkle a little pepper and salt
over the ribs, and replace the shoulder for a few
moments; after which, put the shoulder on another
dish; and proceed to divide the neck from the breast,
where the bones have been previously broken; then
separate the gristly part from the breast, the whole
length, and give a little of the gristle with each bone
of the breast or neck, as may be chosen. If any
part of the breast is to be put by to be eaten cold, let
it be sprinkled while hot, with chopped parsley.
All parts of young lamb are nice, but the shoulder
of a fore-quarter is the least approved. It is to be
carved as mutton.</p>

<p><i>The Hind-quarter</i>, is usually divided into the leg
and loin, and is to be carved as mutton. The close
firm flesh about the knuckle is reckoned the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pork.</span>—<i>The Leg</i>, whether roasted or boiled, is
sent to table with the back upwards, like a leg of
mutton roasted: it is to be carved as mutton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Ham</span> may be carved three several ways; viz.
The <i>first</i> and most common way is to cut off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
hock, and then to take off thin slices, in a circular
manner, round the bone, towards the thick part and
proceed as with venison. This is the most economical
way.</p>

<p>The <i>second</i> way is to cut a round hole in the top
of the ham with a sharp pointed knife, and to enlarge
the circle by cutting out thin slices. This is a good
way, as it keeps the meat moist, and preserves the
gravy.</p>

<p>The <i>other</i> way is, to cut across, near the middle
of the ham, quite down to the bone, and then to
take off thin slices each way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tongue.</span>—A tongue is to be cut <i>across</i> towards
the thickest end; slices taken from that part, both
ways, are the most tender and juicy; towards the tip
of the tongue, the meat is hardest and dryest. For
the fat and kernel, cut off a slice from the lower side
of the root.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sucking Pig.</span>—The head and collar is usually
cut off, and the carcase slit down the back into two
equal parts; the head being also divided and laid at
each end, and the ears on each side. But if the
pig be sent up whole, before any one be helped,
the shoulders and legs should be separated from the
body, and the ribs divided into two or more parts;
the shoulders may each be divided into two or more
parts, also; and nice slices may be taken from the
gammon and fleshy parts. The ribs are very delicious,
but the collar and neck are most esteemed;
the chaps are also much approved by many.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Venison.</span>—<i>The Haunch.</i> First make a deep
incision across, down to the bone, towards the knuckle
end, to let out the gravy; then turn the broad end
towards you, and take off thinnish deep slices, <i>lengthwise</i>,
from the cross cut to the end. The fat, which
is the most delicious part, lies, as in a shoulder of
mutton, in the round prominent part, which, when
the broad end is towards you, will be on the left
side. Give some of this, and also some of the gravy,
with each slice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hare.</span>—The best and readiest way to cut up a
hare, is to put the point of the knife under the point
of the shoulder, and cut all the way down to the
rump, on both sides of the back at equal distances
from the back-bone, dividing the body into three
parts; the middle or back may then be cut across
the spine, into four or more pieces. These are by
far the most tender and delicate, and the fullest of
gravy. The shoulders or wings must be taken off in
a circular direction, and the legs may be easily separated
from the belly. The shoulders and legs
may each be divided. The pieces of the back, and
the fleshy parts of the shoulders and legs, should
be given with a spoonful of the stuffing and gravy to
those most respected. This method can only be
practised when the Hare is young. If it be old, do
not endeavour to divide it lengthwise, but put the
knife between the leg and back, and give it a turn
inwards, at the joint, which you must try to hit.—A
nice cut or two may then be taken from each side
of the back-bone;—then divide the back into parts,
and take off the wings, which are called the sportsman’s
pieces. When all are helped, cut off the head,
and separate the ears, close to the roots, which some
may approve; then with your knife divide the upper
from the lower jaw, and laying the upper one flat on
your plate, enter the point of your knife in the centre
near the back of the skull, and divide it in two. The
head and brains are liked by some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rabbit.</span>—A rabbit is to be carved as a hare in the
latter way; but it being smaller, the body may be
divided into fewer parts, and the head, the ears having
been taken off, may be given, to any one who likes it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goose.</span>—A goose, fowl, turkey, pheasant, and
partridge, are to be cut up nearly alike. First cut
off the apron of the goose, and pour into the body
a glass of port wine, and the gravy, well mixed with
a large teaspoonful of ready made mustard; then
turn the neck towards you, and cut the whole breast
into long slices quite down to the bone, and take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
them off; turn the goose upon one side, and proceed
to take off the leg, by putting the fork through
the small end of the bone, and pressing it close to
the body, which will raise the leg from the body
and shew the direction in which the knife may be
passed, in order to separate it; this may then be
done by turning it back, but if it be an old bird, it
will require some strength. To take off the wing,
pass the fork into the small end of the pinion, and
press it close to the body, then enter the knife at the
point of the wing, and divide the joint (which requires
some practice to hit cleverly) and separate it
from the side. Next take off the merry-thought,
at the neck end, across the body, and where it joins
the body, on each side, you will find the joint of the
neck bones, then put in the knife, and pass it the
longest part of the bone, when you will lift it up and
break it off from the breast bone, to which it is attached.
All parts being thus separated from the
carcase, divide the breast from the back by cutting
through the tender ribs on each side from one end
to the other. Then lay the back upwards, fix your
fork under the rump, and pressing the edge of your
knife hard across the back, lift up the rump, and
the body will divide into two parts. The rump part
may then be divided into three, cutting it lengthwise
through the bones on each side of the back, and
taking off the side-bones. It is not always necessary
to cut up the whole goose, at once, but as you proceed,
the breast may be distributed, the fleshy parts
of the wings, when disjointed from the pinions, and
the thigh parts of the legs, (the drum sticks being
taken off), may next be given, remembering to draw
out the sage and onions, gravy, &amp;c. from the inside,
and give a spoonful on each plate. The neck-bone
and merry-thought are approved by some, and others
approve different parts of the carcase, which are very
savoury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Green Goose</span> must be cut up the same way;
and the best parts are the breast, and the gristle at
the lower end of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fowl.</span>—Fowls, whether roasted or boiled, are to
be cut up alike. The best way is to take the bird on
your plate, and sticking your fork into the breast,
upright, cut of slices, down the breast on each side,
as long as you can; then proceed to take off the legs,
by passing the knife between the legs and the body
from the upper part of the thigh towards the rump.
Next take off the wings by entering your knife at
the point of the shoulder, and with your fork lift up
the pinion and drawing the wing towards you, by
which means it will separate very nicely without
cutting. After this, take off the merry-thought, the
neck-bones, and all the remaining parts, as described
in the goose. The prime parts of a fowl are the
wings, breast, and merry-thought: the legs are coarse
dry, and of a darker colour, except those of a chick,
which are full of gravy and most esteemed. The
drum-sticks should be cut off from the legs of the
fowl at the joint, when given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turkey.</span>—A turkey is to be dissected as a fowl
or goose, but it has no merry-thought. The white
meats of a Turkey are best. The gizzard is sometimes
scored in different directions, and when salted
and peppered, it is sent down to be broiled; is divided
into several parts, and sent round to the company
as a <i>bonne bouche</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pheasant.</span>—This bird is to be carved the same
way as a fowl, first cutting off the head. The best
parts of the pheasant are the breast, wings, and
merry-thought; but the leg has a higher flavour.
The head is sometimes preferred, because of the
brains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Partridge.</span>—Partridges are to be carved as
fowls.—The prime parts, as of nearly all birds, are
the white meats; viz. the wings (the tip of which
is reckoned the most delicious morsel,) the breast,
and merry-thought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pigeons.</span>—Pigeons are generally divided into
two parts, to do which there are several ways; the
most fashionable of which is, to cut from the top<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
of the leg on each side, quite through and across the
body to the breast bone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span>,—in general, requires but little carving.</p>

<p><i>A Cod’s head.</i> The thick fleshy part on the back
and shoulders, close to the head, is most esteemed,
but many parts of the jowl are very delicious, particularly
those about the jaw-bones, which consist
of a fine jelly. The tongue, palate, and firm parts
about the back-bone on the shoulders are also considered
as dainties.</p>

<p>Take off a large piece across the shoulders, close
to the head, and quite through to the back-bone,
this will lay bare the sound, which is under the
back-bone, some of which should be taken out with
a spoon, and given with every slice. Care must be
taken to preserve the beautifully fine flakes of this
fish entire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salmon</span> and all other fish that have a short grain,
should be cut with the slices the long way of the
fish, and not across. The belly part is the richest
and most esteemed of salmon, but the head, and
particularly the jowl, afford many rich and delicate
bits, which are much prized.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold">BUTCHERS’ MEAT.</p>

<p class="noindent center"><i>General observations respecting it.</i></p>

<p class="hanging"><span style="font-size: 150%;">☞</span> <i>The best of every kind of provision is cheapest,
affords most nourishment, and goes farthest.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> this is the most nourishing of all animal food,
and constitutes a considerable portion of our constant
aliment, a knowledge, not only of the nature
and properties of the several kinds of animals destined
for our use, but also of the manner in which
they have been bred and fed, would be very essential
if to be obtained, as it would enable us to judge
of their wholesomeness, and their fitness for our
healthful support and nourishment.</p>

<p>The flesh of cattle, of all kinds, fatted in confined
and filthy places, on oil-cakes, or rank and half-decayed
vegetables, should be rejected, as unfit for
use. On the contrary, those animals which have
been bred and pastured in open situations, on high
lands, extensive downs, dry commons, heaths, and
large enclosures, where the air is pure, and particularly
where the grass is short and sweet, and where
they require much exercise to obtain their sustenance,
have their juices pure, their flavour excellent,
and the texture of their flesh delicate, nutritive,
and wholesome. Hence the superiority of the Welch
and South Down mutton, the Scotch and Welch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
beef, &amp;c. This fact is clearly evinced in the superior
qualities that venison, and the flesh of all wild
animals possess over that of tame ones.</p>

<p>Buttocks of beef, fillets of veal, and legs of
mutton and lamb, as they have most solid meat and
least bone, in proportion, are best for large families.</p>

<p>The most economical way for marketing, is to
buy what roasting and boiling pieces you want in
one lot. Butchers will sell quantities, thus assorted,
much cheaper than they will sell single joints; and
prime roasting joints, when bought alone, are
always charged extravagantly.</p>

<p>Beef and mutton, of a proper age, is more easy
of digestion, and more nutritious, than veal and
lamb. The same remark holds with respect to
pork; for though young pigs are fat and luscious,
yet they are not so nutritive as those of more mature
age. The heart and other viscera of animals are
nutritious, but hard to digest. Pork is a strong
meat, but that which is fed at dairies, is mildest and
best. Fat meat is not so easy of digestion as the
flesh of well fed animals, though not so fat. The
flesh of old animals is dry and hard of digestion,
and affords but little nourishment.</p>


<p class="noindent center bold p1">BEEF.</p>

<p class="noindent center"><i>Instructions for choosing it.</i></p>

<p>An ox is in its prime, for food, at five or six years
old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Beef</span> is never out of season, but it is in the
<i>greatest perfection</i> in November, December, and
January.</p>

<p>The lean of the finest ox-beef, if of a proper age,
has a fine smooth grain, it is of a bright or carnation
red, feels tender, and appears to be marled
or intermixed with fat. The fat parts are firm, of
a cream colour, and rather white than yellow.
This latter distinction is of importance, because, if
the beef be old, the fat will be yellow and skinny;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
and if the ox has been unnaturally fed, or in a confined
place, and particularly if it has been fed with
oil-cake, it will be very yellow, soft, flabby, and
greasy. On the other hand, if the beef be too
young, the fat will be white, almost like mutton
fat, and the lean will be of a pale colour.</p>

<p>The grain of <i>cow-beef</i> is closer than that of the
ox, and the lean is of a darker red.</p>

<p><i>Heifer-beef</i> has all the appearances and qualities
of good ox-beef, except that the grain of the
lean is of a finer texture.</p>

<p><i>Bull-beef</i> is coarser and redder than any other,
the fat hard and skinny, and it has a strong, rank
smell.</p>

<p>Veal ought to be fine in the grain, firm, white,

the eyes will be full and bright, the flesh not clammy
but dry, and the large vein of the shoulder of a
bright red. The kidney taints soonest, and if that
be sweet, and neither soft nor slimy, the whole calf
is fresh. On the contrary, if any part of the flesh be
green or yellow, or feels flabby, it is stale. The
fillet of a cow-calf is preferable on account of the
udder, but the meat of the bull-calf is generally
firmest, whitest, and best, when dressed. The
finest calves have the smallest kidneys.</p>

<p class="noindent center"><i>Instructions for choosing it.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mutton</span> is <i>best</i> from <i>Christmas</i> to <i>Midsummer</i>.</p>

<p>When, if in its prime, (that is about four years of
age,) it will feel tender when pinched with the finger
and thumb, but if older, it will feel harder and
fibrous. The grain of the lean should be a fine deep
red, the colour bright, and the fat firm and white.
Wether mutton is the best flavoured, and may be
known by a prominent lump of fat at the edge of
the broadest part. Ewe mutton is paler than wether
mutton, is of a finer texture and of less value; ram
mutton is strong flavoured, high coloured, and its
fat is spungy.</p>

<p>The mutton of the small Welch sheep, which
are driven up, and fatted on Banstead Heath, and
the mutton bred and fed on the South Downs, in
Sussex, are the most esteemed in London. At Bath,
the short-shanked Dorsetshire, and the Lansdown
mutton are most in request; in Yorkshire and the
northern counties, the Moor mutton; and in Norfolk
and Suffolk the long-shanked is most approved; but
the sheep bred in the Fens and deep lands of Lincolnshire,
and that neighbourhood, are large, coarse-grained,
and ill-flavoured.—Mutton tastes strong
of the coat in May and June, or just before shearing.</p>

<p class="noindent center"><i>Instructions for choosing it.</i></p>

<p>Lamb, like veal, is fresh when the eyes are full
and bright, and the vein in the neck is of a fine blue
colour; but if it be green or yellow, or if there be
a faint smell about the kidney, it is stale. The
earliest house-lamb, in London, is from the Dorsetshire
ewes, which are sold in great numbers at Weyhill-Fair,
on the 10th of October, whence they are
driven towards London, quite forward, frequently
dropping their lambs on the road. This comes in
at or before Christmas, and is generally cut into
quarters. Grass-lamb comes into season about Easter,
and when large and plentiful is cut up in joints,
like mutton.</p>


<p class="noindent center bold p1">PORK.</p>

<p class="noindent center"><i>Directions for choosing it.</i></p>

<p>The rind of all pork should be thin, and if young<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
and properly fed, the lean will break when pinched,
and will be smooth and of a delicate white; the fat
will be white and fine, and the joints will look blue;
but if the rind be tough and loose, or thick and hard,
and the joints look red, it is old. If the flesh be
clammy it is stale. The knuckle part taints first.
When measles are seen in the fat, the meat is unwholesome,
and should not be eaten. A pig is in its
prime at two years old.</p>

close to the bone. If there be any appearance of
yellow, it is rusty. The Wiltshire and Hampshire

<p class="noindent center bold p1">GAME.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Venison</span> is chosen by its fat, which should be
thick, clear, and bright. A knife stuck in under
the shoulder or shank will shew whether it be sweet.
If venison looks green, or approaching to black, it is
stale.</p>

<p>The <i>Joints</i> of Venison are only four; viz. The
haunch, neck, breast, and shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hares.</span>—The claws of a young hare are smooth
and sharp, the ears are tender and will easily tear,
and the cleft of the lip is narrow; but the claws of
an old hare are blunt and rugged, the ears dry and
tough, and the cleft of the lip is wide, and the
haunch is thick.—If fresh the body will be stiff. A
hare is best when kept ten days or a fortnight, which,
in favourable weather, may be done; but it should
always be dressed as soon as it begins to bleed at the
nose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leverets</span> may be distinguished from hares, by
their having a knob or small bone on the fore leg,
near the foot, which hares have not. Leverets will
not keep, therefore should be dressed as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rabbits.</span>—The age of Rabbits, whether wild or
tame, may be known by nearly the same rules as
that of Hares: observe also, that if old, their hairs
are intermixed with the wool, their claws will be
limber, and their flesh, instead of being white, will
have a blue cast, and be slimy.</p>


<p class="noindent center bold p1">POULTRY.</p>

<p>(<span class="smcap">Poultry</span> <i>is in the greatest perfection when most
plentiful. It is generally dearest from February to
Midsummer, and cheapest in September.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geese.</span>—The bill and feet of a young Goose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
will be yellow, the breast fat and plump, and the
fat white and soft; but if old, the bill and feet will
be red, and the fat yellow and skinny. If fresh, the
feet will be limber, but if stale, stiff and dry.
Green-Geese are in season in April, May, and June.
They should be scalded. Stubble-Geese come into
season in September.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turkeys.</span>—Choose cock birds. The very best
have black legs, but the white legged birds are
nearly as fine. If young their legs will be smooth,
and the spurs of the cock will be very short and
tender; but if old, the legs will be rough, and the
spurs long and hard, unless filed or cut off. But
the best criterion, by which to judge of both Turkeys
and Fowls with certainty is, that the toes and
bills, if they be young, will be soft and pliable, but
will feel hard and stiff, if old. A Turkey should
be kept without meat thirty-six hours before it is
killed, and should be hung up in its feathers a
week before it is dressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fowls.</span>—Young Pullets are in their prime before
they begin to lay; but Hen Fowls are best when
full of eggs, at which time the vent is soft. The
comb, skin, and legs of old Hens are rough. A good
Capon has a large rump, and much fat at the shoulders,
and its comb is pale.</p>

<p>To know whether any kind of Fowl in its feathers
is fit to dress, pull the feathers off the vent very
gently, and if they come off easily, it ought to be
dressed immediately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ducks</span> and <span class="smcap">Ducklings</span>.—These may be chosen
by the same rules as Turkeys and Fowls; but the
bills and feet of wild Ducks are smaller and redder
than those of tame ones; their plumage too is different.
Young wild Ducks will not keep. All
young Ducks should be scalded, as that sweetens
them, and improves their flavour.</p>

<p>[Norfolk is famous for Turkeys, Geese, and
Ducks; Surrey and Sussex for Fowls and Ducklings.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
The Dorking Fowls are in high estimation
in London.]</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pigeons.</span>—These birds should be both young
and fresh, and when they are so, they are fat and
full at the vent; their legs are limber and of a
dusky white: young Pigeons have also a yellow
down round their necks and heads. If old, their
legs and feet are large, harsh, and red, and the vent
discoloured and flabby. Tame Pigeons are best, as
wood Pigeons are harder and darker coloured.</p>


<p class="noindent center bold p1">WILD FOWL.</p>

<p>To judge whether these are young and fresh,
observe the rules given above for tame Fowls; recollect
also that these birds should be fat, and when
they are so, they will be hard at the vent; if stale,
the skin will peel off when rubbed with the finger.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pheasants.</span>—Cock Pheasants are best. Hens
are excellent when full of eggs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Woodcocks.</span>—These are fine, high-flavoured
birds, and when in the best condition, they feel
thick and firm, and have a vein of fat down the
sides of the breast. When stale they run at the nostrils.
<i>Land Rails and Snipes</i> are chosen by these
rules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Partridges.</span>—The yellow legs of young partridges
become blue when old, and their bills changed
from yellow to a dark hue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Quails.</span>—These come chiefly from France and
Germany, but the finest and best that are sold in
London, come from Cambridgeshire, and are fed by
the poulterers with herbs, seed, or boiled bread and
milk. They are so extremely delicate, in feeding, that
two of them will not eat out of the same trough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teal</span> is of a beautiful plumage, and very delicate
to eat. Their bills and feet are black, and are
shaped like those of a Duck.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ruffs</span> and <span class="smcap">Rees</span> are chiefly found in Lincolnshire
and Cambridgeshire; and in April or May,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
when most in season, they are a perfect lump of
fat. If poor, when caught, they should be fattened
with white bread and milk boiled, given them in
separate troughs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moor Game</span>, and even <span class="smcap">Grouse</span>, may be kept
good a long time. Old birds of all kinds will keep
longest, and will be the better for keeping; but
young birds should be dressed soon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Small Birds</span>, of every description, should be
dressed immediately.</p>


<p class="noindent center bold p1">FISH.</p>

<p class="noindent center"><i>General Rules for choosing it.</i></p>

<p>(<i>The price of fish depends on the supply; and
it will often be found, that one kind of fish, equally
as good and seasonable as another, may be bought for
much less money; therefore, never buy at an extravagant
price.</i>)</p>

<p>When fish is fresh, it is firm, bright, and stiff;
the gills are of a lively red, hard to open, and smell
sweet; and the eyes are full and clear. If stale,
the whole fish, and particularly the gills and fins,
will always be flabby and limber, the gills will be
pale, and the eyes sunk and dull. By these rules
alone, good fish may be distinguished from bad; but
besides these, some kinds of fish have other distinguishing
peculiarities, which are as follow; viz.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sturgeon.</span>—The grain of the flesh of a fine
Sturgeon is smooth and very white, interspersed
with blue veins. The skin is soft and tender, and
its smell is very pleasant. When the veins and
gristles are brown or yellow, instead of blue, or the
skin is hard and dry, the fish is not good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Caviare.</span>—This is the roe of the female Sturgeon.
It should be taken out and beaten flat, then sprinkled
with salt and dried, first in the sun and air, and
afterwards in an oven, till it becomes very dry and
of a reddish brown colour. Thus prepared, it is a
fine relish; it is to be eaten with oil and vinegar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Turbot</span>, when good, is thick, firm, and plump;
and the nose, and fins all round the belly, tinged with
a pink colour; but if it has lost this beautiful tinge,
or if the belly be changed from a yellowish white to
a blueish cast, the fish is either stale or poor, or both.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soles</span> are to be chosen by these rules, particularly
as to the pink tinge round their bellies and under
their noses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cod Fish</span> should be thick at the neck, having
the gills red, the flesh very white, firm, hard, and
dear, and the eyes bright.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Haddock</span> are to be chosen by these rules. The
shortest fish are the best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Salmon</span> should be chosen for its small head and
thick neck; its scales should be bright, and its gills
and flesh of a fine red colour. The Thames and
Severn Salmon are mostly esteemed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Skate</span>, <span class="smcap">Maids</span>, and <span class="smcap">Thornbacks</span> are all of one
species; they ought to be white and thick. The
two latter should be kept a day, or perhaps two,
to make them tender, and Skate may be kept
longer. The maiden Skate and the young male,
or Thornback, are the best; but large, old Skate, is
generally coarse and rank.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Flounders</span>, <span class="smcap">Plaice</span>, &amp;c. should be stiff and
firm, with bright, full eyes. If flabby, these and all
other kinds of fish are certainly stale. The Thames
Flounders are reckoned best, in London, because
they may be had alive, or nearly so, and they are always
best when dressed as soon as caught.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herrings</span>, <span class="smcap">Pilchards</span>, <span class="smcap">Whitings</span>, <span class="smcap">Sprats</span>,
&amp;c.—These may be classed together. The largest
are the best. Their gills should be of a fine red,
their fins stiff, their eyes bright, and their flesh,
when best, is bright and firm. As the Herrings emigrate,
in immense shoals, from the northern regions,
they are in the greatest perfection on their first
arrival on the coasts of Scotland, the North of Ireland,
and the Isle of Man. On the coast of the German
Ocean also, even so far south as Yarmouth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
they are taken in great quantities, remarkably fat
and fine, and full of spawn; but before they reach
the southern coast of England, they become poor
and thin, and are then known by the denomination
of Shotten-Herrings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mackerel</span> look beautifully bright when first
caught. These and <span class="smcap">Whitings</span> should be dressed
as soon as possible.</p>


<p class="noindent center bold p1">FRESH WATER FISH.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pike</span> and <span class="smcap">Jack</span> are taken in rivers; they are very
dry eating, and require much seasoning and sauce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carp</span>, <span class="smcap">Tench</span>, and <span class="smcap">Perch</span>, are best eaten as
soon as caught; the latter is not so much esteemed
as the two former.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Smelts</span>, when fresh, have a fine bright appearance,
firm flesh, and a fragrant smell, like a cucumber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gudgeons</span>, <span class="smcap">Roach</span>, and <span class="smcap">Dace</span>, and most other
river fish, must be chosen by the rules already given.</p>


<p class="noindent center bold p1">BUTTER, CHEESE, and EGGS.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Butter</span> should be chosen by the taste and smell.—The
best fresh butter is the Epping, and next the
Cambridge; sometimes the potted weekly Dorset
is very good. Of tub butter, the Welch is best,
the Dutch next, and the Irish worst. In examining
tub-butter, and particularly the Irish, look at and
smell to the outside next the cask, which is often
white in appearance like tallow, and quite rank in
smell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cheese.</span> Of the common kinds, Cheshire, North
Wiltshire and double Gloucester, are the best.
Cheese of the first making, in May, is usually
brought to Market in August. Factors have a pernicious
practice of sticking brass pins into cheese,
which gives it the appearance of blue mould and
old age. That cheese which has a smooth, moist coat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
is generally good. Spanish arnatto is often used to
give the rind a beautiful red colour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eggs</span>.—If fresh, will feel warm when the tongue
is applied to the biggest end; but if stale, it will
be cold. An egg, when quite fresh, will sink at once
when put into cold water; but if rotten, it will swim.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p><i>Here follow a great variety of the most
useful and approved</i> <span class="smcap">receipts in domestic
economy</span>, <i>which are chiefly appropriate to the
Housekeeper’s department; consisting of directions
for making</i> <span class="smcap">pastry, confectionary,

<p class="noindent center bold p1">OBSERVATIONS ON PASTRY.</p>

<p>An adept in making pastry, never leaves any
part of it adhering to the board used in making
it. It is best when rolled on marble or slate.
In hot weather the butter should be put in cold
water to make it firm; and if the pastry be
made early in the morning, and preserved from
the air till baked, it will be the better. Salt
butter, if good and well washed, makes a fine
flaky crust.</p>

<p>Preserved fruit for pastry need not be baked;
but the crust should be baked in a tin shape,
or on a tin and cut out according to taste.</p>


<p class="noindent center bold p1">ON MAKING CAKES.</p>

<p>Currants should be nicely washed, dried
in a cloth, and then set before the fire. If
not quite dry they will make the cake heavy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
The cake will be the lighter if a dust of flour
be thrown on the currants and then shaken.</p>

<p>Eggs should be beaten very long, the whites
and the yolks apart, after which, they must be
strained.—Sugar should be rubbed to a powder,
on a clean board, and sifted through a fine
hair or lawn sieve. Lemon-peel should be
pared quite thin, and beaten, with a little sugar,
in a marble mortar, to a paste; and then
mixed with a little wine or cream, so as to mix
easily with the other ingredients. After all the
articles are put together in the pan, they should
be thoroughly beaten for a long while, as the
lightness of the cake greatly depends on their
being well incorporated. Yeast, in either
black or white plum cakes, makes them require
less butter and eggs, and yet be equally light
and rich. The dough when made should be
set to rise by the fire. If the oven be not
<i>quick</i> the batter will not rise, and the cake
will be heavy: if you think it too quick, put
some paper over the cake to prevent its being
burnt.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">1. A RICH PLUM CAKE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take one pound of fresh butter, one pound of sugar, one
pound and a half of flour, two pounds of currants, a glass
of brandy, one pound of sweatments, two ounces of sweet
almonds, ten eggs, a quarter of an ounce of allspice, and a
quarter of an ounce of cinnamon.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Melt the butter to a cream, and put in the sugar. Stir
it till quite light, adding the allspice, and pounded cinnamon;
in a quarter of an hour take the yolks of the eggs, and
work them in, two or three at a time; and the whites of
the same must by this time be beaten into a strong snow
quite ready to work in; as the paste must not stand to
chill the butter, or it will be heavy, work in the whites
gradually; then add the orange-peel, lemon, and citron, cut
in fine stripes, and the currants, which must be mixed in
well, with the sweet almonds. Then add the sifted flour and
glass of brandy. Bake this cake in a tin hoop in a hot oven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
for three hours, and put twelve sheets of paper under it to
keep it from burning.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">2. A GOOD PLAIN CAKE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The following is a receipt for making a good plain cake,
to be given to children, at breakfast, instead of <i>buttered
bread</i>.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take as much dough as will make a quartern-loaf (either
made at home, or procured at the baker’s), work into this
a quarter of a pound of butter, a quarter of a pound of
moist sugar, and a handful of caraway seeds. When well
worked together, pull into pieces the size of a golden pippin,
and work it together again. This must be done <i>three</i>
times or it will be in lumps, and heavy when baked.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">3. ICEING FOR CAKES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Put one pound of fine-sifted, treble refined sugar into
a basin, and the whites of three new-laid eggs; beat the
sugar and eggs up well with a silver spoon until it becomes
very white and thick; dust the cake over with flour, and then
brush it off, by way of taking the grease from the outside,
which prevents the iceing from running; put it on smooth
with a palette knife, and garnish according to fancy: any
ornaments should be put on immediately; for if the iceing gets
dry, it will not stick on. Set it in a cool oven to harden.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">4. A RICH SEED CAKE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take a pound and a quarter of flour well dried, a pound
of butter, a pound of loaf sugar, beat and sifted, eight
eggs and two ounces of caraway seeds, one grated nutmeg,
and its weight in cinnamon. Beat the butter into a cream,
put in the sugar, beat the whites of the eggs and the yolks
separately, then mix them with the butter and sugar. Beat
in the flour, spices, and seed, a little before sending it away.
Bake it two hours in a quick oven.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">47. TO PREPARE SUGAR FOR CANDYING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The first process is <i>clarifying</i>, which is done thus. Break
the white of an egg into a preserving pan; put to it 4 quarts
of water, and beat it with a whisk to a froth. Then put in 12
pounds of sugar, mix all together, and set it over the fire.
When it boils put in a little cold water, and proceed as often
as necessary, till the scum rises thick on the top. Then remove
it from the fire, and when it is settled, take off the
scum, and pass it through a straining bag. If the sugar
should not appear very fine, boil it again before straining it.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">48. TO CANDY SUGAR.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">After having completed the above first process, put what
quantity is wanted over the fire, and boil it till it is smooth
enough. This is known by dipping the skimmer into the
sugar, and touching it between the forefinger and thumb;
and immediately on opening them a small thread will be observed
drawn between, which will crystallize and break, and
remain in a drop on the thumb, which will be a sign of its
gaining some degree of smoothness. Boil it again, and it will
draw into a larger string; it is now called <i>bloom sugar</i>, and
must be boiled longer than in the former process. To try its
forwardness, dip again the skimmer shaking off the sugar into
the pan; then blow with the mouth strongly through the
holes, and if certain bladders go through, it has acquired
the second degree: to prove if the liquid has arrived at the
state called <i>feathered sugar</i>, re-dip the skimmer, and shake it
over the pan, then give it a sudden flirt behind, and the sugar
will fly off like feathers.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">It now arrives to the state called <i>crackled sugar</i>, to obtain
which the mass must be boiled longer than in the preceding
degree; then dip a stick in it, and put it directly into a pan
of cold water, draw off the sugar which hangs to the stick in
the water, and if it turns hard and snaps, it has acquired the
proper degree of crystallization, if otherwise, boil it again
until it acquires that brittleness.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The last stage of refining this article is called <i>caramel sugar</i>,
to obtain which it must be boiled longer than in any of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
preceding methods; prove it by dipping a stick first in the
sugar, and then into cold water, and the moment it touches
the latter, it will, if matured, snap like glass. Be careful
that the fire is not too fierce, as by flaming up the sides of
the pan, it will burn, discolour, and spoil the sugar.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">49. <i>French Method.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Put into a pan syrup enough of clarified sugar to fill the
moulds; boil it until it comes to the state called <i>small feather</i>,
skim it well, take the pan from the fire, and pour it into a
small quantity of spirit of wine, sufficient to make it sparkle;
let it rest till the skin, which is the candy, rises on the surface;
take it off with a skimmer, and pour it directly into
a mould; which keep in the stove at 90 degrees heat for eight
days; then strain the candy by a hole, slanting the mould
on a bason or pan, to receive the drainings; let it drain till
it is perfectly dry, then loosen the paper by moistening it with
warm water: warm it all round near the fire, and turn the
candy by striking it hard on the table. Put it on a sieve in
the stove, to finish drying it; but do not touch it while there,
and keep up an equal heat, otherwise there will be only a
mash instead of a candy. Spirit of wine will take off grease,
and not affect the candy, as it soon evaporates.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">When finished in the syrup, put a layer into a new sieve,
and dip it suddenly into hot water to take off the syrup
that hangs about it: put it into a napkin before the fire to
drain, and then do more in the sieve. Have ready sifted
double refined sugar, which shake over the fruit till covered
quite white. Set it on the shallow end of the sieve in a
warm oven, and turn it two or three times. It must not be
cold till dry. Watch it carefully.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">51. BARLEY SUGAR.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take a quantity of clarified sugar in that state that on
dipping the finger into the pan the sugar which adheres to it
will break with a slight noise; this is called <i>crack</i>. When
the sugar is near this, put in two or three drops of lemon
juice, or a little vinegar to prevent its graining. When it has
come to the <i>crack</i>, take it off instantly, and dip the pan
into cold water, to prevent its burning; let it stand a little,
and then pour it on a marble which must be previously
rubbed with oil. Cut the sugar into small pieces, when it
will be ready for use. One drop of citron will flavour a
considerable quantity.</p>

state called a <i>blow</i>, which may be known by dipping the
skimmer into the sugar, shaking it, and blowing through the
holes, when parts of light may be seen: add a drop of any
esteemed essence. If the <i>bon-bons</i> are preferred white, when
the sugar has cooled a little, stir it round the pan till it grains,
and shines on the surface; then pour it into a funnel and fill
the little moulds, when it will take a proper form and harden:
as soon as it is cold take it from the moulds; dry it
two or three days, and put it upon paper. If the <i>bon-bons</i>
are required to be coloured, add the colour just as the sugar

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">84. WHIPT CREAM.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Mix the whites of eight eggs, a quart of thick cream, and
half a pint of sack, sweeten them to taste with double refined
sugar. It may be perfumed with a little musk or ambergris
tied in a rag and steeped in a little cream. Whip it up with
a whisk, and some lemon-peel tied in the middle of the whisk.
Then lay the froth with a spoon on the glasses, or basins.</p>

with a spoonful of brandy. Put them into a pan with a pint
of good cream and the yolks of two eggs beaten fine. Stir
it gently over the fire till it grows thick, and then put it
into a China soup plate. When it is cold stick it over with
small pieces of the nuts, and send it to table.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">86. ICE CREAM.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">To a pound of any preserved fruit add a quart of good
cream, squeeze the juice of two lemons into it and some
sugar to taste. Let the whole be rubbed through a fine
hair sieve, and if raspberry, strawberry, or any red fruit,
add a little cochineal to heighten the colour: have the freezing
pot nice and clean; put the cream into it and cover it;
then put it into the tub with ice beat small, and some salt;
turn the freezing pot quick, and as the cream sticks to the
sides, scrape it down with an ice-spoon, and so on till it
is frozen. The more the cream is worked to the side with
the spoon, the smoother and better flavoured it will be.
After it is well frozen, take it out and put it into ice shapes
with salt and ice: then carefully wash the shapes for fear of
any salt adhering to them; dip them in lukewarm water and
send them to table.</p>

pint of good cream, a little currant jelly, and some cold
clarified sugar; rub this well through the tammy, and put
it in an ice pot well covered; then set it in a tub of broken
ice with plenty of salt; when it grows thick about the sides,
stir it with a spoon, and cover it close again till it is perfectly
frozen through; cover it well with ice and salt both under
and over, and when it is frozen change it into a mould and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>

a pound and a half of loaf sugar broken into small pieces.
Stir it till the sugar is melted; when it boils skim it quite
clean. Boil it pretty quick over a clear fire, till it jellies,
which is known by dipping a skimmer into the jelly and
holding it in the air; when it hangs to the spoon in a drop,
it is done. If the jelly is boiled too long it will lose its
flavour and shrink very much. Pour it into pots, cover them

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">TO PRESERVE FRUITS.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> rules are necessary to be observed in
this branch of confectionary.</p>

<p>In the first place, observe, in making syrups,
that the Sugar is well dissolved before it is
placed on the fire, otherwise the scum will not
rise well, nor the fruit obtain its best colour.</p>

<p>When stone fruits are preserved, cover them
with mutton suet rendered, to exclude the air;
as air is sure to ruin them.</p>

<p>All wet sweet-meats must be kept dry and
cool to preserve them from mouldiness and
damp.</p>

<p>Dip a piece of writing paper in brandy, lay
it close upon the sweetmeats, cover them tight
with paper, and they will keep well for any
length of time; but they will inevitably spoil
without these precautions.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">104. TO BOTTLE DAMSONS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Put damsons, before they are too ripe, into wide-mouthed
bottles, and cork them down tight; then put them into a
moderately heated oven, and about three hours will do
them; observe that the oven is not too hot, otherwise it will
make the fruit fly. All kinds of fruits that are bottled may
be done in the same way, and they will keep two years;
after they are done, they must be put away with the mouth
downward, in a cool place, to keep them from fermenting.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">105. TO PRESERVE BARBERRIES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Set an equal quantity of barberries and sugar in a kettle
of boiling water, till the sugar is melted and the barberries
quite soft; let them remain all night. Put them next day
into a preserving pan, and boil them fifteen minutes, then
put them into jars, tie them close, and set them by for use.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">106. GRAPES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take close bunches, whether white or red, not too ripe,
and lay them in a jar. Put to them a quarter of a pound of
sugar candy, and fill the jar with common brandy. Tie
them up close with a bladder, and set them in a dry place.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">107. TO DRY CHERRIES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Having stoned the desired quantity of morello cherries,
put a pound and a quarter of fine sugar to every pound;
beat and sift it over the cherries, and let them stand all
night. Take them out of their sugar, and to every pound
of sugar, put two spoonsful of water. Boil and skim it well,
and then put in the cherries; boil the sugar over them, and
next morning strain them, and to every pound of syrup put
half a pound more sugar; boil it till it is a little thicker, then
put in the cherries and let them boil gently. The next day
strain them, put them in a stove and turn them every day
till they are dry.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">108. TO CLARIFY HONEY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The best kind is clarified by merely melting it in a water
bath, and taking off the scum; the middling kind by dissolving
it in water, adding the white of an egg to each pint
of the solution; and boiling it down to its original consistence,
skimming it from time to time. The inferior kind
requires solution in water, boiling the solution with one
pound of charcoal, to 25 pounds of honey, adding, when an
excess of acid is apprehended, a small quantity of chalk or
oyster-shell powder; next by straining it several times
through flannel, and reducing the solution to its original
consistence by evaporation.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">109. TO PRESERVE CANDIED ORANGE FLOWERS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Free them from their cups, stamina, and pistils, put four
ounces into one pound of sugar boiled to a candy height, and
poured on a slab, so as to be formed into cakes.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">110. TO PRESERVE FRUITS IN BRANDY, OR OTHER SPIRITS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Gather plums, apricots, cherries, peaches, and other juicy
fruits, before they are perfectly ripe, and soak them for some
hours in hard, or alum water, to make them firm; as the
moisture of the fruit weakens the spirit, it ought to be
strong, therefore, add five ounces of sugar to each quart of
spirit.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">111. SEVILLE ORANGES, WHOLE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Cut a hole at the stem end of the oranges, the size of sixpence,
take out all the pulp, put the oranges into cold water
for two days, changing it twice a day; boil them rather more
than an hour, but do not cover them, as it will spoil the
colour; have ready a good syrup, into which put the oranges,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
and boil them till they look clear; then take out the seeds,
skins, &amp;c. from the pulp first taken out of the oranges, and
add to it one of the whole oranges, previously boiled, with
an equal weight of sugar to it and the pulp; boil this together
till it looks clear, over a slow fire, and when cold fill
the oranges with this marmalade, and put on the tops; cover
them with syrup, and put brandy paper on the top of the
jar. It is better to take out the inside at first, to preserve
the fine flavour of the juice and pulp, which would be injured
by boiling in the water.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">112. CUCUMBERS AND MELONS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take large cucumbers, green, and free from seed, put
them in a jar of strong salt and water, with vine leaves on
the top, set them by the fire side till they are yellow; then
wash and set them over a slow fire in alum and water,
covered with vine leaves; let them boil till they become
green; take them off, and let them stand in the liquor till
cold: then quarter them, and take out the seed and pulp;
put them in cold spring water, changing it twice a day for
three days. Have ready a syrup made thus: to one pound
of loaf sugar, half an ounce of ginger bruised, with as much
water as will wet it; when it is quite free from scum, put
in, when boiling, the rind of a lemon and juice; when quite
cold, pour the syrup on the melons. If the syrup is too thin,
after standing two or three days, boil it again, and add a
little more sugar. A spoonful of rum, gives it the West-Indian
flavour. Girkins may be done the same way. One
ounce of alum, when pounded, is sufficient for a dozen melons
of a middling size.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">113. STRAWBERRIES, WHOLE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take an equal weight of fruit and double refined sugar,
lay the former in a large dish, and sprinkle half the sugar
in fine powder; give a gentle shake to the dish, that the
sugar may touch the under side of the fruit. Next day make
a thin syrup with the remainder of the sugar; and allow one
pint of red currant juice, to every three pounds of strawberries;
in this simmer them until sufficiently jellied.
Choose the largest scarlets, not dead ripe.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">114. APRICOTS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Infuse young apricots before their stones become hard,
into a pan of cold spring water, with plenty of vine leaves;
set them over a slow fire until they are quite yellow, then
take them out and rub them with a flannel and salt to take
off the lint; put them into the pan to the same water and
leaves, cover them close at a distance from the fire, until
they are a fine light green, then pick out all the bad ones.
Boil the best gently two or three times in a thin syrup,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
and let them be quite cold each time before you boil them.
When they look plump and clear, make a syrup of double
refined sugar, but not too thick; give your apricots a gentle
boil in it, and then put them into the pots or glasses, dip a
paper in brandy, lay it over them, tie them close, and keep
them in a dry place.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">115. CANDIED ANGELICA.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The stalks are to be boiled for a quarter of an hour in
water, to take away their bitterness, and some of the strong
scent; they are then to be put into syrup, boiled to a full

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Put an ounce of roche alum beat very fine, into a large
pan of boiling hard water; place a few gooseberries at the
bottom of a hair sieve, and hold them in the water till they
turn white. Then take out the sieve, and spread the gooseberries
between two cloths; put more into the sieve, and
repeat it till they are all done: Put the water into a glazed
pot until the next day, then put the gooseberries into wide-mouthed
bottles; pick out all the cracked and broken ones,
pour the water clear out of the pot, and fill the bottles with
it, cork them loosely, and let them stand a fortnight. If
they rise to the corks, draw them out and let them stand two
or three days uncorked, then cork them close again.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">PICKLING.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> branch of domestic economy comprises
a great variety of articles which are
essentially necessary to the convenience of
families.</p>

<p>It is too prevalent a practice to make use
of brass utensils to give pickles a fine colour.
This pernicious custom is easily avoided by
heating the liquor and keeping it in a proper
degree of warmth before it is poured upon
the pickle. Stone or glass jars are the best
adapted for sound keeping.</p>

<p>Pickles should never be handled with the
fingers, but taken out by a spoon, with holes
in it, kept for the purpose.</p>

<p>The strongest vinegar must be used for
pickling. It must not be boiled, as thereby
the strength of the vinegar and spices will be
evaporated. By parboiling the pickles in brine,
they will be ready in half the time they would
otherwise be. When taken out of the hot
brine, let them get cold and quite dry before
you put them into the pickle.</p>

<p>The articles to be pickled should be perforated
with a larding pin, in several places,
by which means they will the more readily
imbibe the flavour of the pickle.</p>

<p>The spices, &amp;c. generally used, are those
mentioned in the following receipt for walnuts.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">118. TO PICKLE WALNUTS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Make a brine of salt and water, with a quarter of a
pound of salt to a quart of water. Soak the walnuts in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
for a week, and if you wish to have them ready the sooner,
run a larding pin through them, in half a dozen places, which
will make them much softer and better flavoured. Put
them into a stew-pan with the brine, and give them a gentle
simmer. Lay them on a sieve to drain, then put them on a
fish plate in the open air, a couple of days, or till they turn
black. Put them into unglazed or stone jars, about three parts
full, and fill up the jars with the following pickle;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and when
they have been done about a week, open them and fill them
up again, and so on continually, or else they will be spoiled.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">119. ONIONS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Put a sufficient quantity into salt and water for nine
days, observing to change the water every day; next put
them into jars and pour fresh boiling salt and water over
them, cover them close up till they are cold, then make a
second decoction of salt and water, and pour it on boiling.
When it is cold drain the onions on a hair sieve, and put
them into wide-mouthed bottles; fill them up with distilled
vinegar; put into every bottle a slice or two of ginger, a
blade of mace, and a tea-spoonful of sweet oil, which will
keep the onions white. Cork them well up, and keep them
in a dry place.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">120. SAUR KRAUT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take a large strong wooden vessel, or cask, resembling a
salt-beef cask, and capable of containing as much as is sufficient
for the winter’s consumption of a family. Gradually
break down or chop the cabbages (deprived of outside
green leaves,) into very small pieces; begin with one or two
cabbages at the bottom of the cask, and add others at intervals,
pressing them by means of a wooden spade, against
the side of the cask, until it is full. Then place a heavy
weight upon the top of it, and allow it to stand near to a
warm place, for four or five days. By this time it will have
undergone fermentation, and be ready for use. Whilst the
cabbages are passing through the process of fermentation, a
very disagreeable fetid, acid smell is exhaled from them;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
now remove the cask to a cool situation, and keep it always
covered up. Strew aniseeds among the layers of the cabbage
during its preparation, which communicates a peculiar
flavour to the Saur Kraut at an after period.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In boiling it for the table, two hours is the period for it to
be on the fire. It forms an excellent nutritious and antiscorbutic
food for winter use.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">121. PECCALILLI:—INDIAN METHOD.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">This consists of all kinds of pickles mixed and put into
one large jar—girkins, sliced cucumbers, button onions,
cauliflowers, broken in pieces. Salt them, or put them in a
large hair sieve in the sun to dry for three days, then scald
them in vinegar for a few minutes; when cold put them together.
Cut a large white cabbage in quarters, with the
outside leaves taken off and cut fine, salt it, and put it in
the sun to dry for three or four days; then scald it in vinegar,
the same as cauliflower, carrots, three parts boiled in
vinegar and a little bay salt; French beans, rock-samphire,
reddish pods, and nastertiums, all go through the same
process as girkins, capsicums, &amp;c. To one gallon of vinegar
put four ounces of ginger bruised, two ounces of whole
white pepper, two ounces of allspice, half an ounce of chillies
bruised, four ounces of turmeric, one pound of the best mustard,
half a pound of shalots, one ounce of garlic and half
a pound of bay salt. The vinegar, spice, and other ingredients,
except the mustard, must boil half an hour; then
strain it into a pan, put the mustard into a large basin, with
a little vinegar; mix it quite fine and free from lumps, then
add more; when well mixed put it to the vinegar just
strained off, and when quite cold put the pickles into a large
pan, and the liquor over them; stir them repeatedly so as to
mix them all; finally, put them into a jar, and tie them over
first with a bladder, and afterwards with leather. The
capsicums want no preparation.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">122. SAMPHIRE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Put what quantity is wanted into a clean pan, throw over it
two or three handsful of salt, and cover it with spring water
for twenty-four hours; next put it into a clean saucepan,
throw in a handful of salt, and cover it with good vinegar.
Close the pan tight, set it over a slow fire, and let it stand
till the samphire is green and crisp; then take it off instantly,
for should it remain till it is soft, it will be totally
spoiled. Put it into the pickling pot and cover it close;
when it is quite cold tie it down with a bladder and leather,
and set it by for use. Samphire may be preserved all
the year by keeping it in a very strong brine of salt and
water, and just before using it, put it for a few minutes into
some of the best vinegar.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">123. MUSHROOMS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Put the smallest that can be got into spring water, and
rub them with a piece of new flannel dipped in salt. Throw
them into cold water as they are cleaned, which will make
them keep their colour; next put them into a saucepan
with a handful of salt upon them. Cover them close and set
them over the fire four or five minutes, or till the heat draws
the liquor from them; next lay them betwixt two dry cloths
till they are cold; put them into glass bottles and fill them
up with distilled vinegar, with a blade of mace, and a teaspoonful
of sweet oil in every bottle; cork them up close
and set them in a dry cool place; as a substitute for distilled
vinegar, use white wine vinegar, or ale. Allegon will do, but
it must be boiled with a little mace, salt, and a few slices
of ginger, and it must be quite cold before it is poured upon
the mushrooms.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">124. <i>Another Method.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Bruise a quantity of well-grown flaps of mushrooms with
the hands, and then strew a fair proportion of salt over
them; let them stand all night, and the next day put them
into stew-pans; set them in a quick oven for twelve hours,
and strain them through a hair sieve. To every gallon of
liquor put of cloves, Jamaica black pepper, and ginger, one
ounce each, and half a pound of common salt; set it on a
slow fire, and let it boil till half the liquor is wasted; then
put it into a clean pot, and when cold bottle it for use.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">125. CUCUMBERS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Let them be as free from spots as possible; take the
smallest that can be got, put them into strong salt and water
for nine days, till they become yellow; stir them at
least twice a day; should they become perfectly yellow,
pour the water off and cover them with plenty of vine leaves.
Set the water over the fire, and when it boils, pour it
over them, and set them upon the earth to keep warm.
When the water is almost cold make it boil again, and
pour it upon them; proceed thus till they are of a fine
green, which they will be in four or five times; keep them
well covered with vine leaves, with a cloth and dish over
the top to keep in the steam, which will help to green them.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When they are greened put them in a hair sieve to drain,
and then to every two quarts of white wine vinegar put
half an ounce of mace, ten or twelve cloves, an ounce of
ginger cut into slices, an ounce of black pepper, and a
handful of salt. Boil them all together for five minutes;
pour it hot on the pickles, and tie them down for use.
They may also be pickled with ale, ale vinegar, or distilled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
vinegar, and adding three or four cloves of garlic and
shalots.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">126. ARTIFICIAL ANCHOVIES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">To a peck of sprats put two pounds of salt, three ounces
of bay-salt, one pound of salt-petre, two ounces of prunella,
and a few grains of cochineal; pound all in a mortar, put
into a stone pan first a layer of sprats, and then one of the
compound, and so on alternately to the top. Press them
down hard; cover them close for six months, and they will
be fit for use, and will really produce a most excellent flavoured
sauce.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">127. SALMON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Boil the fish gently till done, and then take it up, strain
the liquor, add bay leaves, pepper corns, and salt; give
these a boil, and when cold add the best vinegar to them;
then put the whole sufficiently over the fish to cover it,
and let it remain a month at least.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">128. TO PRESERVE FISH BY SUGAR.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Fish may be preserved in a dry state, and perfectly
fresh, by means of sugar alone, and even with a very small
quantity of it.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Fresh fish may be kept in that state for some days, so as
to be as good when boiled as if just caught. If dried, and
kept free from mouldiness, there seems no limit to their
preservation; and they are much better in this way than
when salted. The sugar gives no disagreeable taste.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This process is particularly valuable in making what is
called kippered salmon; and the fish preserved in this manner
are far superior in quality and flavour to those which
are salted or smoked. If desired, as much salt may be used
as to give the taste that may be required; but this substance
does not conduce to their preservation.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In the preparation, it is barely necessary to open the
fish, and to apply the sugar to the muscular parts, placing
it in a horizontal position for two or three days, that this
substance may penetrate. After this it may be dried; and it
is only further necessary to wipe and ventilate it occasionally,
to prevent mouldiness.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">A table spoonful of brown sugar is sufficient in this manner
for a salmon of five or six pounds weight; and if salt is
desired, a tea spoonful or more may be added. Saltpetre
may be used instead, in the same proportion, if it is desired
to make the kipper hard.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">129. TO SALT HAMS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">For three hams pound and mix together half a peck of
salt, half an ounce of salt prunella, three ounces of salt-petre,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
and four pounds of coarse salt; rub the hams well with this,
and lay what is to spare over them, let them lie three days,
then hang them up. Take the pickle in which the hams were,
put water enough to cover the hams, with more common salt,
till it will bear an egg, then boil and skim it well, put it in
the salting tub, and the next morning put it in the hams;
keep them down the same as pickled pork; in a fortnight
take them out of the liquor, rub them well with brine, and
hang them up to dry.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">130. TO DRY SALT BEEF AND PORK.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Lay the meat on a table or in a tub with a double bottom,
that the brine may drain off as fast as it forms, rub the
salt well in, and be careful to apply it to every niche; afterwards
put it into either of the above utensils; when it must
be frequently turned, after the brine has ceased running, it
must be quite buried in salt, and kept closely packed. Meat
which has had the bones taken out is the best for salting.
In some places the salted meat is pressed by heavy weights,
or a screw, to extract the moisture sooner.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">131. TO PICKLE IN BRINE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">A good brine is made of bay salt and water, thoroughly
saturated, so that some of the salt remains undissolved; into
this brine the substances to be preserved are plunged, and
kept covered with it. Among vegetables, French beans,
artichokes, olives, and the different sorts of samphire, may be
thus preserved, and among animals, herrings.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">132. <i>To Salt by another Method.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Mix brown sugar, bay salt, common salt, each two pounds,
saltpetre eight ounces, water two gallons; this pickle gives
meats a fine red colour, while the sugar renders them mild
and of excellent flavour.—Large quantities are to be managed
by the above proportions.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">BRITISH WINES.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> different processes in wine making, range
themselves under the following heads:</p>

<p>Gathering the fruit,—picking the fruit,—bruising
the fruit,—and vatting the fruit.</p>

<p>Vinous fermentation, flavouring the wine,—drawing
the must,—pressing the husks,—casking
the must.</p>

<p>Spirituous fermentation, racking the wine,—fuming
the wine,—bottling and corking the
wine.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">APPARATUS FOR WINE MAKING.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">To make wine well, and with facility, persons
should have all the requisite apparatus,
namely, the <i>vats, vat-staff, fruit-bruiser,
strainer, hair-bags, canvas-bags, wine-press,
thermometer, and bottling-machine</i>.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">133. GATHERING THE FRUIT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Fruit of every description, says Mr. Carnell, in his excellent
treatise on wine making, should be gathered in fine weather;
those of the berry kind often appear ripe to the eye before
they really are so, therefore it is requisite to taste them
several times in order to ascertain that they are arrived at
the crisis of maturity. If the fruit be not ripe, the wine
will be harsh and hard, and unpleasant to the palate, and
more so to the stomach; it will also take more spirit and
saccharine, and take a longer time to be fit for the table.
If the fruit be too ripe, the wine from it will be faint, low,
and vapid; it will not be strong and generous; it will also
require more trouble, additional spirit, and expense.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">134. PICKING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Detach the unripe and bad berries: the result when the
wine is drank, will be greatly superior in richness. Pick
the stalks from grapes, currants, and gooseberries, previously
to their being placed in the vat.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">135. BRUISING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The quantity of fruit for making a vintage of domestic
wine, is not so large but it may be bruised in a tub, and from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
thence removed into the vat, or if the quantity be very
small, it may be bruised in the vat. While the fruit is picking
by one person, another may bruise it, and as it is bruised
remove it into the vat. When Malaga or Smyrna raisins
are used, they are to be put into the vat with the water, to
soak, and the following day taken out and bruised, then
returned into the vat again.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">136. VATTING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The first thing to be done is to place the guard against
the tap-hole, to prevent the husks escaping at the time the
must or extract is drawn off. When all the fruit is in the
vat the water should be added, and the contents stirred with
the vat-staff, and left to macerate until the next day, when
sugar, tartar, &amp;c. diluted with some of the liquor, is to be
put into the vat, and the whole again stirred up. The place
where the vat is situated should have a free circulation of
air, and a temperature of not less than 58 degrees. If the
vinous fermentation do not take place, in a reasonable time,
the contents must be often stirred, and the place made
warmer.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">137. VINOUS FERMENTATION.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The time of a vinous fermentation commencing is always
uncertain; it depends much on the quality and quantity of
the contents of the vat, on its local situation, on the season
or weather, and most particularly on the greenness or ripeness
of the fruit. To produce a medium vinous fermentation,
the vats and contents ought to be placed in a temperature
from 60 to 70 degrees. And if this is found not to
produce fermentation in a short time, the temperature of the
place must be made warmer, and the vat often stirred with
the vat-staff.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The commencement of the vinous fermentation may be
known by plunging the thermometer into the middle of the
vat, for a minute, and when taken out, if a fermentation
has commenced, the temperature of the contents will be
higher than at the place where the vats are situated. When
the vinous fermentation begins, it is very conspicuous, and
may be known by its taste, smell, appearance, and effects.
The contents will first gently rise, and swell with a slight
movement and a little hissing. A considerable motion will
take place, and the contents will increase in heat and bulk,
while a quantity of air escapes.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">It is impossible to lay down an exact time for a vinous
fermentation; but for eighteen gallons, two or three days
are generally sufficient for white wines; and red wines
require a day or two more.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">138. FLAVOURING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">When the vinous fermentation is about half over, the
flavouring ingredients are to be put into the vat and well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
stirred into the contents. If almonds form a component
part, they are first to be beaten to a paste and mixed with a
pint or two of the must. Nutmegs, cinnamon, ginger, seeds,
&amp;c. should, before they are put into the vat, be reduced to
powder, and mixed with some of the <i>must</i>.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">139. DRAWING THE MUST.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">When the must in the vat gives, by tasting, a strong
vinous pungency, that is the period to stop the remaining
slight fermentation, by drawing off the must, in order to have
strong and generous wine.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">A cock, or spicket and faucet, is to be put into the tap-hole
of the vat, and the must drawn off and put into open
vessels, there to remain till the pressing is finished.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">140. PRESSING THE HUSKS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">As soon as all the must is drawn off from the vat, the
husks are to be put into hair-bags, and the mouth of each
bag is to be well fastened, then put into the press, and
the whole pressed without delay. The must that is pressed
out is to be mixed with the must that was drawn off from
the vat. Many ways may be contrived for pressing a small
vintage, for those persons who cannot afford to purchase a
proper wine-press; but several wines do not require pressing;
and may be strained through a sweet, clean, canvas bag,
made with a pointed end downwards.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">141. CASKING THE MUST.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Each cask is to be filled, within about an inch of the
bung-hole, which should be covered over lightly with a flat
piece of wood. The must now is perfectly cool and calm,
and will remain in this state until the spirituous fermentation
commences.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">142. SPIRITUOUS FERMENTATION.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The spirituous fermentation is essentially necessary to the
clarification, goodness, and perfection of the wine. If the
vinous fermentation has been well conducted, and the wine
cellar be not too cold, a spirituous fermentation will commence
in a few days, and abate in six or twelve days, the
time depending on circumstances, and on the quality and
quantity of the wine. The brandy or spirit assigned should
at this time be put to the wine by pouring it in gently without
disturbing the wine. The cask now, if not full, must be
filled up and bunged with a wooden bung covered with a
piece of new canvass larger than the bung. In about a
month after the spirit has been added, the cask will again
want filling up; this should be done with the overplus of the
vintage, if not with some other good wine, and the cask
re-bunged very tight. The cask should be pegged once a
month or oftener to see if the wine be clear and not thick,
and as soon as it is fine and bright, it must be racked off its lees.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">143. RACKING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">This is an operation highly requisite to the keeping wine
good; to its purification, strength, colour, brilliancy, richness,
and flavour, and is performed by drawing off the <i>wine</i>
and leaving the <i>lees</i> in the cask. A siphon should be used
but if not, the cask should be tapped two or three days
previously. It may be racked off into another cask, or
into a vat or tub, and returned into the same cask again,
<i>after it has been well cleaned</i>; and, if requisite, the cask may
be slightly fumigated, immediately before the wine is returned
into it. If the wine, on being tasted, is found weak,
a little spirit is to be given to it, the cask filled up and
bunged tight.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The racking off ought to be performed in temperate
weather, and as soon as the wines appear clear, a <i>second
racking</i> will make them <i>perfectly brilliant</i>, and if so they will
want no fining.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">144. FINING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Many wines require fining <i>before</i> they are racked, and the
operation of fining is not always necessary. Most wines,
well made, do not want fining; this may be ascertained by
drawing a little into a glass, from a peg-hole.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">One of the best finings is as follows:—Take one pound
of fresh marsh-mallow roots, washed clean, and cut into
small pieces; macerate them in two quarts of soft water, for
twenty-four hours, then gently boil the liquor down to three
half pints, strain it, and when cold, mix with it half an
ounce of pipe-clay or chalk, in powder, then pour the
mucilage into the cask, and stir up the wine so as not to
disturb the lees, and leave the vent-peg out for some days
after.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Or, take boiled rice, two table-spoonsful, the white of
one new egg, and half an ounce of burnt alum, in powder.
Mix with a pint or more of the wine, then pour the mucilage
into the cask, and stir the wine with a stout stick, but not to
agitate the lees.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Or, dissolve, in a gentle heat, half an ounce of isinglass
in a pint or more of the wine, then mix with it half an
ounce of chalk, in powder; when the two are well incorporated,
pour it into the cask, and stir the wine so as not to
disturb the lees.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">As soon as wines are clear and bright, after being fined
down, they ought to be racked into a sweet and clean cask,
the cask filled up and bunged tight.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">145. BOTTLING AND CORKING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Fine clear weather is best for bottling all sorts of wines,
and much cleanliness is required. The first consideration,
in bottling wines, is to examine and see if the wines are in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
a proper state. <i>The wines should be fine and brilliant</i>, or they
will never brighten after.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The bottles must be all sound, clean, and dry, with plenty
of good sound corks.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The cork is to be put in with the hand, and then driven
well in with a flat wooden mallet, the weight of which ought
to be a <i>pound and a quarter</i>, but however, not to exceed a
pound and a half, for if the mallet be too light or too heavy
it will not drive the cork in <i>properly</i>, and may <i>break the bottle</i>.
The corks must so completely fill up the neck of each
bottle as to render them <i>air tight</i>, but leave a space of an
inch between the wine and the cork.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When all the wine is bottled, it is to be stored in a cool
cellar, and on <i>no account on the bottles’ bottoms</i>, but on their
sides and in saw-dust.</p>

add about three pounds of fine loaf-sugar: mix the whole

RESEMBLING CHAMPAIGNE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">To each Scotch pint of full ripe gooseberries, mashed,
add one Scotch pint of water, milk-warm, in which has
been dissolved 1&#160;lb. of single refined sugar: stir the whole
well, and cover up the tub with a blanket, to preserve the
heat generated by the fermentation of the ingredients: let
them remain in this vessel three days, stirring them twice or
three times a day: strain off the liquor through a sieve,
afterwards through a coarse linen cloth; put it into the
casks it will ferment without yeast. Let the cask be kept
full with some of the liquor reserved for the purpose. It
will ferment for ten days, sometimes for three weeks: when
ceased, and only a hissing noise remains, draw off two or
three bottles, according to the strength you wish it to have,
from every 20 pint cask, and fill up the cask with brandy
or whiskey; but brandy is preferable. To make it very
good, and that it may keep well, add as much sherry,
together with a ¼&#160;oz. of isinglass dissolved in water to make
it quite liquid; stir the whole well. Bung the cask up, and
surround the bung with clay; the closer it is bunged the
better; a fortnight after, if it be clear at the top, taste it;
if not sweet enough, add more sugar; 22&#160;lbs. is the just
quantity in all for 20 pints of wine; leave the wine six
months in the cask; but after being quite fine, the sooner
it is bottled, the more it will sparkle and resemble champaigne.
The process should be carried on in a place where
the heat is between 48° and 56° Fahrenheit.—N. B. Currant
wine may be made in the same manner.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">180. BIRCH WINE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The season for obtaining the liquor from birch-trees, is
in the latter end of February, or the beginning of March,
before the leaves shoot out, and as the sap begins to rise.
If the time is delayed, the juice will grow too thick to be
drawn out. It should be as thin and clear as possible.
The method of procuring the juice, is by boring holes in the
trunk of the tree, and fixing faucets of elder; but care
should be taken not to tap it in too many places at once,
for fear of injuring the tree. If the tree is large, it may
be bored in five or six places at once, and bottles are to be
placed under the apertures for the sap to flow into. When
four or five gallons have been extracted from different trees,
cork the bottles very close and wax them till the wine is to
be made, which should be as soon as possible after the sap
has been obtained. Boil the sap, and put four pounds of
loaf sugar to every gallon, also the peel of a lemon cut
thin; then boil it again for nearly an hour, skimming it
all the time. Now pour it into a tub, and as soon as it is
cold, work it with a toast spread with yeast, and let it
stand five or six days, stirring it twice or three times each
day. Into a cask that will contain it, put a lighted brimstone
match, stop it up till the match is burnt out, and then
pour the wine into it, putting the bung lightly in, till it
has done working. Bung it very close for about three
months, and then bottle it. It will be good in a week after
it is put into the bottles.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Birch wine may be made with raisins in the following
manner: To a hogshead of birch-water, take four hundred
of Malaga raisins: pick them clean from the stalks, and
cut them small. Then boil the birch liquor for one hour
at least, skim it well, and let it stand till it be no warmer
than milk. Then put in the raisins, and let it stand close
covered, stirring it well four or five times every day. Boil
all the stalks in a gallon or two of birch liquor, which,
when added to the other, when almost cold, will give it an
agreeable roughness. Let it stand ten days, then put it in
a cool cellar, and when it has done hissing in the vessel,
stop it up close. It must stand at least nine months before
it is bottled.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">182. BLACKBERRY WINE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Having procured berries that are fully ripe, put them
into a large vessel of wood or stone, with a cock in it, and
pour upon them as much boiling water as will cover them.
As soon as the heat will permit the hand to be put into the
vessel, bruise them well till all the berries are broken.
Then let them stand covered till the berries begin to rise
towards the top, which they usually do in three or four
days. Then draw off the clear into another vessel, and add
to every ten quarts of this liquor, a pound of sugar. Stir
it well and let it stand to work a week or ten days, in another
vessel like the first. Then draw it off at the cock
through a jelly-bag into a large vessel. Take four ounces
of isinglass, and lay it to steep twelve hours in a pint of
white wine. The next morning, boil it upon a slow fire till
it is all dissolved. Then take a gallon of blackberry-juice,
put in the dissolved isinglass, give them a boil together,
and pour all into the vessel. Let it stand a few days to
purge and settle, then draw it off, and keep it in a cool place.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">183. SPRUCE WINE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">For this, which is only a superior sort of white spruce
beer, proceed as follows: To every gallon of water take
1½&#160;lbs. of honey, and ½ a pound of fine starch. The starch,
however, previously to its being blended with the honey,
liquor, or syrup, must be reduced to a fine transparent
jelly, by boiling it with part of the water purposely preserved.
A quarter of a pound of essence of spruce may be
used to 6 gallons of water; and the same method may be
pursued in working, fining, and bottling, as directed for
white spruce beer.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Spruce is a wholesome and pleasant drink to those who
are used to it, and persons soon become habituated. It
contains a vast quantity of fixed air, which is extremely
bracing; and the use of this liquor is particularly to be
recommended to such as are troubled with scorbutic
humours, or have the gravel. It is chiefly used in summer.</p>

stones may be taken out, then mash them gently, and
add a little water and honey. Add to every gallon of the
pulp a gallon of spring water, with a few bay-leaves and
cloves; boil the mixture, and add as much sugar as will
well sweeten it; skim off the froth and let it cool. Now
press the fruit, squeezing out the liquid part; strain all
through a fine strainer, and put the water and juice together
in a cask. Having allowed the whole to stand and ferment for
three or four days, fine it with white sugar, flour, and whites
of eggs; draw it off into bottles, then cork it well. In twelve
days it will be ripe, and will taste like weak Port, having
the flavour of Canary.</p>

Let it stand two days, then draw it off and put it into a

require so much sweetening. To give it a curious flavour,
boil an ounce of mace, and half an ounce of nutmegs, in a

egg. It is then put into a barrel; and after the fermentation
is commenced, the cask is filled every day, for three or four
days, that the froth may work out of the bung-hole.
When the fermentation moderates, put the bung in loosely,
lest stopping it tight might cause the cask to burst. At the
end of five or six weeks, the liquor is to be drawn off into
a tub, and the whites of eight eggs, well beaten up, with
a pint of clean sand, is to be put into it: then add a gallon
of cider spirit; and after mixing the whole together, return
it into the cask, which is to be well cleaned, bunged tight,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
and placed in a proper situation for racking off, when fine.
In the month of April following, draw it off into kegs, for
use; and it will be equal to almost any foreign wine.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">259. <i>To stop the Fermentation of Wine.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">It is in the first place necessary to consider whether the
existing state of fermentation be the original or secondary
stage of that process which comes on after the former has
ceased for several days, and is indeed the commencement of
acetous fermentation. That of the former kind rarely proceeds
beyond what is necessary for the perfect decomposition of the
saccharine and other parts of the vegetable substances necessary
for the production of spirit, unless the liquor be kept too
warm, or is too weak, and left exposed to the air after the
vinous fermentation is completed. The means to correct these
circumstances are sufficiently obvious. The heat for spirituous
fermentation should not be above 60 degrees Fahrenheit;
when it is much above that point, the liquor passes rapidly
through the stage of vinous fermentation, and the acetous
immediately commences. When too long-continued fermentation
arises from the liquor having been kept in a warm
situation, it will be soon checked by bunging, after being
removed into a cold place; the addition of a small proportion
of spirits of wine or brandy, previously to closing it
up, is also proper. A degree of cold, approaching to the
freezing point, will check fermentation of whatever kind.
Fermentation of this kind cannot be stopped by any chemical
agent, except such as would destroy the qualities of
the liquor intended to be produced.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The secondary stage of fermentation, or the commencement
of the acetous, may be stopped by removing the liquor
to a cool situation; correcting the acid already formed; and
if the liquor contain but little spirit, the addition of a proper
proportion of brandy is requisite.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The operation of racking is also necessary to preserve
liquor in a vinous state, and to render it clear. This process
should be performed in a cool place.</p>

it, which by heating the spirit over a gentle fire, will melt:
after which dip a piece of cloth into it, and when a little
dry, set on fire with a brimstone match, put it into the bung-hole,
and stop it up close.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">261. <i>Another Method.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">First prepare a fresh empty cask, that has had the same
kind of wine in it which is about to be racked, then match
it, and rack off the wine, putting to every ten gallons two
ounces of oyster powder, and half an ounce of bay-salt, then
get the staff and stir it well about, letting it stand till it is
fine, which will be in a few days; after which rack it off
into another cask, (previously matched) and if the lees
of some wine of the same kind can be got, it will improve
it much.—Put likewise a quart of brandy to every ten gallons,
and if the cask has been emptied a long time, it will
match better on that account; but if even a new cask, the
matching must not be omitted. A fresh empty cask is to be
preferred.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">N. B. This method will answer for all made wines.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">262. A NEW METHOD OF MAKING CURRANT WINE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Boiling the fruit is a practice of decided advantage.
From this treatment many tasteless fruits acquire a flavour,
as is well known, and many bad flavours are converted into
agreeable ones. In no case perhaps is this more remarkable
than in the black currant, which, harsh and comparatively
insipid in its natural state, acquires by boiling a powerful,
and, to most persons, a highly agreeable flavour. In making
wine from this variety of currant, the effects of this process
are very remarkable; the produce of the raw fruit being
scarcely distinguished by any particular property from the
herd of made wines, while that of the boiled fruit may with
careful management be brought to resemble some of the
best of the sweet Cape wines. In the white and red currant
the same precaution has been attended with results
equally successful, though not marked by a contrast so decided.
If sweet wine is intended, the quantity of fruit
for 10 gallons should not exceed 40 pounds; if dry wine is
desired, it may extend to 60. The proportion of sugar will
be 30 pounds as before. If a much stronger wine of either
quality is desired, it must extend to 40 pounds. Unsound
or bruised fruit should be rejected; and the remains of the
blossom and fruit stalk carefully removed.</p>

jars, so that it may come out in lumps, like the Spanish

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Suet is the basis of all the soaps of the toilette, known by
the name of Windsor soap, because olive-oil forms a paste
too difficult to melt again, and contains an odour too strong
to be mixed with essences. The suet soap dissolved hot in
alcohol retakes its solid state by cooling. To this fact is due
the discovery of transparent soap, which, if well prepared,
has the appearance of candied sugar; it may also be coloured,
and the vegetable hues for this purpose, are preferable
to mineral; any person may make this soap, by putting in a
thin glass phial, the half of a cake of Windsor soap-shavings;
fill it with one half of alcohol, and put it near the fire until
the soap is dissolved; this mixture, placed into a mould to
cool, produces the transparent soap.</p>

if more, add distilled water, and if less evaporate. Then add
one third of oil of almonds, simmer them together for some
hours, or until the oil forms a jelly; when cool, which may
be tried on a small quantity, add common salt, and then continue
boiling till the soap is solid; when cold, skim off the

<p class="takeof-noindent">In mixing, place pieces of soap, and coloured powder, in
layers in the box, making, in all, four alternate layers of
each. When a layer of each has been placed in the box,
sprinkle a pint of rose-water over the <i>cut soap</i>; for if it be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
much combined with the powder, it will become lumpy and
hard, and consequently spoil the wash-balls. The same quantity
of rose-water is to be used for moistening each of the
other soap layers. Next mix a pint of thin starch, which has
been well boiled in half a pint of rain water, with half a pint
of rose-water, and distribute it equally well mixed among
the mass, by turning it over repeatedly, and then press it
down close with the hands. If a piece be now cut out from
the mass, the operator will perceive whether the marbling is
sufficiently good; and if so, he may proceed immediately to
form his wash-balls.</p>

pounds, and put to it of deer’s, goat’s, or lamb’s suet, (which
has previously been well cleansed from all skins, &amp;c. by
rose-water,) two pounds, and one pound of olive-oil, or rather
behn-nut oil. Let all these simmer over the fire in a well-glazed
pot, until it be pretty nearly of the consistence of
crown or Naples soap; then turn it out into a large flat pan,
which set on the leads or roof of the house, exposed to the
heat of the sun for fifty days. The pan must be covered over
with a bell glass, such as the gardeners use, and the mixture
must be stirred once a day, during the whole of this time.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In about six weeks or two months, the operator will have a
most excellent ground-work for Naples soap, which only requires
perfuming in the following manner, to render it even
preferable to the foreign sorts.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take of oil of rhodium, one ounce, of spirit of ambergris,
two ounces and a half, spirit of musk, half an ounce;
mix these well together, and then put the compound into the
pan of soap. Stir the whole well, and incorporate the perfumes
with the soap, on a marble stone by means of a muller.
Put up into small jars, or preserve in a mass in a large jar,
according to sale or convenience. If kept for twelve months,
this soap will be found, by comparison, to be far preferable
to the best soap that ever came from Naples.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent"><span class="smcap">Rub</span> three pounds of rose-leaves for
three minutes with a pound of common salt.
The flowers being bruised by the friction of
the grains of salt, form a paste, which is to

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">341. GENERAL RULES FOR THE DISTILLATION
OF SIMPLE WATERS.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">1. Plants and their parts ought to be fresh
gathered. When they are directed fresh, such
only must be employed; but some are allowed
to be used dry, as being easily procurable in
this state at all times of the year, though rather
more elegant waters might be obtained from
them whilst green.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">2. Having bruised the subjects a little, pour
thereon thrice their quantity of spring water.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This quantity is to be diminished or increased,
according as the plants are more or
less juicy than ordinary.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When fresh and juicy herbs are to be distilled,
thrice their weight of water will be
fully sufficient, but dry ones require a much
larger quantity.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In general, there should be so much water,
that after all intended to be distilled has come
over, there may be liquor enough to prevent
the matter from burning to the still.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">3. Formerly, some vegetables were slightly
fermented with the addition of yeast, previous
to their distillation.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">4. If any drops of oil swim on the surface
of the water, they are to be carefully taken off.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">5. That the waters may be kept the better,
about one-twentieth part of their weight of
proof spirit may be added to each after they
are distilled.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">342. STILLS FOR SIMPLE WATERS.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The instruments chiefly used in the distillation
of simple waters are of two kinds, commonly
called the hot still, or alembic, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
cold still. The waters drawn by the cold still
from plants are much more fragrant, and more
fully impregnated with their virtues, than those
drawn by the hot still or alembic.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The method is this:—A pewter body is suspended
in the body of the alembic, and the
head of the still fitted to the pewter body;
into this body the ingredients to be distilled
are put, the alembic filled with water, the still-head
luted to the pewter body, and the nose
luted to the worm of the refrigeratory or worm.
The same intention will be answered by putting
the ingredients into a glass alembic, and
placing it in a bath-heat, or balneum mariæ.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The cold still is much the best adapted to
draw off the virtues of simples, which are
valued for their fine flavour when green, which
is subject to be lost in drying; for when we
want to extract a spirit from plants so light
and volatile, as not to subsist in open air any
longer than while the plant continues in its
growth, it is certainly the best method to remove
the plant from its native soil, into some
proper instrument, where, as it dies, these votile
parts may be collected and preserved. And
such an instrument is what we call the cold
still, where the drying of the plant, or flower,
is only forwarded by a moderate warmth, and
all that rises is collected and preserved.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">343. EXPEDITIOUS MODE OF DISTILLING SIMPLE WATERS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Tie a piece of muslin or gauze over a glazed earthern pot,
whose mouth is just large enough to receive the bottom of a
warming-pan; on this cloth lay the herb, clipped; then
place upon them the warming-pan, with live coals in it, to
cause heat just enough to prevent burning, by which means as
the steam issuing out of the herb cannot mount upwards,
by reason of the bottom of the pan just fitting the brim of
the vessel below it, it must necessarily descend, and collect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
into water at the bottom of the receiver, and that strongly
impregnated with the essential oil, and the salt of the vegetable
thus distilled; which, if wanted to make spirituous
or compound water, is easily done, by simply adding some
good spirits, or French brandy to it, which will keep good
for a long time, and be much better than if the spirits had
passed through a still, which must, of necessity, waste
some of their strength. Care should be taken not to let
the fire be too strong, lest it scorch the plants; and to be
made of charcoal, for continuance and better regulation,
which must be managed by lifting up and laying down the
lid, as wanted to increase or decrease the degrees of heat.
The deeper the earthen pan, the cooler the season, and the
less fire at first (afterwards to be gradually raised), in the
greater perfection will the distilled water be obtained.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">As the more moveable, or volatile parts of vegetables,
are the aqueous, the oily, the gummy, the resinous, and the
saline, these are to be expected in the waters of this process;
the heat here employed being so great as to burst the vessels
of the plants, some of which contain so large a quantity of
oil, that it may be seen swimming on the surface of the
water.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Although a small quantity only of distilled waters can
be obtained at a time by this confined operation, yet it
compensates in strength what is deficient in quantity. Such
liquors, if well corked up from the air, will keep good a
long time, especially if about a twentieth part of any spirits
be added, in order to preserve the same more effectually.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">344. ROSEMARY WATER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">As the method of performing the operation by the cold
still is the very same, whatever plant or flower is used, the
following instance of procuring a water from rosemary, will
be abundantly sufficient to instruct the young practitioner
in the manner of conducting the process in all cases whatever.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take rosemary, fresh gathered in its perfection, with the
morning dew upon it, and lay it lightly and unbruised upon
the plate or bottom of the still; cover the plate with its
conical head, and apply a glass receiver to the nose of it.
Make a small fire of charcoal under the plate, continuing
it as long as any liquor comes over into the receiver.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When nothing more comes over, take off the still head,
and remove the plant, putting fresh in its stead, and proceed
as before; continue to repeat the operation successively,
till a sufficient quantity of water is procured. Let
this distilled water be kept at rest in clean bottles, close
stopped, for some days in a cool place; by this means it will
become limpid, and powerfully impregnated with the taste
and smell of the plant.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">361. GENERAL RULES FOR THE DISTILLATION
OF SPIRITUOUS WATERS.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">1. The plants and their parts ought to be
moderately and newly dried, except such as
are ordered to be fresh gathered.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">2. After the ingredients have been steeped
in the spirit for the time prescribed, add as
much water as is sufficient to prevent a burnt
flavour, or rather more.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">3. The liquor which comes over first in distillation
is by some kept by itself, under the
title of spirit; and the other runnings, which
prove milky, are fined down by art. But it is
preferable to mix all the runnings together,
without fining them, that the waters may possess
the virtues of the plant entire.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">4. In the distillation of these waters, the
genuine brandy obtained from wine is directed.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Where this is not to be procured, take, instead
of that proof spirit, half its quantity of
a well rectified spirit, prepared from any other
fermented liquors. In this steep the ingredients,
and then add spring water enough,
both to make up the quantity ordered to be
drawn off, and to prevent burning.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">362. BERGAMOT WATER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take of fine old French brandy, 2 gallons, or 1 gallon of
highly rectified spirit of wine, and 1 gallon of spring water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
Put to the brandy, or diluted spirits, ½ an ounce, or more,
of true Roman oil of bergamot, whose parts have been previously
well divided by trituration with lump sugar, in a
glass mortar.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Now distil by a water heat, and draw off six quarts only.
By this operation, a most excellent bergamot water will be
produced, which will remain good for twenty years.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">363. ORIGINAL RECEIPT FOR HUNGARY WATER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The original receipt for preparing this invaluable lotion,
is written in letters of gold in the hand-writing of Elizabeth,
queen of Hungary.</p>

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Take of aque vitæ, four times distilled, 3 parts,<br>
the tops and flowers of rosemary, 2 parts.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">To be put together in a close-stopped vessel, and allowed to
stand in a warm place, during fifty hours, then to be distilled
in an alembic, and of this, once every week, 1 drachm to be
taken in the morning, either in the food or drink, and every
morning the face and the deceased limb to be washed with it.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">364. <i>Best Hungary Water.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take thirty gallons of spirit of wine; put to it, in a large
still, six large bunches of fine green rosemary, when the
flowers are white, and in full bloom; one pound of lavender-flowers,
and four ounces of true English oil of rosemary.
The rosemary-leaves and flowers must be stripped from all
their wood and green twigs.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When the whole has been in a state of digestion for twenty-four
hours, distil as before, drawing off about twenty-five
or twenty-six gallons, but no more. When distilled, stop it
closely in a copper vessel, and keep it undisturbed for about
a month.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">365. LAVENDER SPIRIT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take 14 pounds of lavender flowers, 10½ gallons of rectified

bath heat.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">366. LAVENDER WATER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take 30 gallons of the best wine spirit; pour it into a
copper still, placed in a hot-water bath, over a clear but
steady fire; put to it 6 pounds of the largest and freshest
lavender flowers, after having separated them from all
stalks and green leaves, which give the lavender-water a
woody and faint smell. Put no water into the still, close
all the junctures well, and let the spirits and flowers stand
in a state of digestion for 24 hours; and then, with a gentle
fire, draw off 25, or, at most, 26 gallons only, which, as soon
as distilled, are to be poured into a copper vessel, for keeping.
Wooden vessels and cans are to be avoided, as the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
parts of the oil, and of the spirits, will be absorbed by
them and consequently lost.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When the distillation is over, draw out, or quench the fire,
and let the remaining spirits and flowers continue in the still
until the next day.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When the above quantity of 25 or 26 gallons has stood for
4 or 5 days, put it to ten ounces of true English oil of lavender.
Mix the whole well in the jar, by drawing out one or
two gallons, and then returning them. Repeat this ten or
twelve times, then stop the vessel up close, and do not disturb
it for a month, at least.</p>

flowers left in the still, after the distillation mentioned in the
last article, add 15 gallons of common proof spirit, 9 or 10
gallons of spring water, 3 pounds of lavender flowers, and
4 ounces of oil of lavender, intimately mixed with loaf-sugar,
by powdering it in a glass mortar.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Digest the whole, and draw off 25 gallons, proceeding in
every respect as before, except that in this case, no oil is
to be added; for, as there is so much water present, the
addition of oil would be apt to turn the whole quantity
muddy, or of a bluish or opaque colour, which it cannot be
easily freed from, without a second distillation.</p>

they are to be put into glass bottles, which are to be well

<p class="takeof-noindent">Vinegar is used chiefly as a sauce, and
to preserve vegetable substances; but it is
employed externally when an over dose of
strong wine, spirit, opium, or other narcotic
poison has been taken. A false strength is
given to it by adding oil of vitriol, or some
acrid vegetable, as pellitory of Spain, capsicum,
&amp;c. It is rendered colourless by adding
fresh burned bone black, 6 ounces to a gallon,
and letting it stand for two or three days to clear.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">376. TO MAKE VINEGAR.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Mix cider and honey, in the proportion of 1&#160;lb. of honey

</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">377. <i>Another Method.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Scheele, a celebrated chymist, has recommended the following
recipe: Take 6 spoonsful of good alcohol; to this,
add 3 pints of milk, and put the mixture into vessels to be
corked close. Vent must be given from time to time to the
gas of fermentation. In the course of a month, this will produce
very good vinegar.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">378. <i>Another.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

composed of 41 wine pints of water, about 8 pints of whiskey,
(<i>l’eau de vin de grain</i>) about 2 wine pints of yeast, and
2 pounds of charcoal, and place it in a proper situation for

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">380. <i>Another.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">To every gallon of water put 1&#160;lb. of coarse Lisbon sugar;
let the mixture be boiled, and skimmed as long as any scum
arises. Then let it be poured into proper vessels; and when
it is as cool as beer, when worked, let a toast, rubbed over
with yeast, be put to it. Let it work about 24 hours, and
then put it into an iron-hooped cask, fixed either near a constant
fire, or where the summer sun shines the greater part
of the day; in this situation it should not be closely stopped
up; but a tile, or something similar, should be laid on the
bung-hole, to keep out the dust and insects. At the end of
about three months (sometimes less) it will be clear and fit
for use, and may be bottled off. The longer it is kept, after
it is bottled, the better it will be. If the vessel containing
the liquor is to be exposed to the sun’s heat, the best time
to begin making it is in the month of April.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">381. WINE VINEGAR.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take any sort of wine that has gone through fermentation,
and put it into a cask that has had vinegar in it; then
take some of the fruit or stalks of which the wine has been
made, and put them wet into an open-headed cask in the
sun, with a coarse cloth over the top of it, for six days—after
which put them in the vinegar, and stir it well about—then
put it in a warm place, if in winter, or if in summer,
put it in a yard in the sun, with a slate over the bung.
When the vinegar is sour enough and fine, rack it off into a
clean sour cask, and bung it up; then put it in the cellar for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
use. Those wines that contain the most mucilage are fittest

Proceed in all other respects as before. This vinegar possesses
a pleasant taste and smell; but raspberry vinegar,

lower temperature of the situation in which the operation is
carried on. During the fermentation, stir the matter from
time to time, and press it down with the hands, that it may
be perfectly soaked. When the fermentation is over, put the
matter to drain upon sieves or strainers. At the bottom of
the vessels will be found a yellow liquor, which must be
thrown away, because it would soon contract a disagreeable
smell, which it would communicate to the vinegar. Then
wash the tubs, put into them the water separated from the
other matter; it immediately begins to turn sour; when the
tubs must be again covered with cloths, and kept moderately
warm. A pellicle, or skin, is formed on their surface, beneath
which the vinegar acquires strength; in a month’s
time it begins to be sharp; it must be left standing a little
longer, and then put into a cask, of which the bung-hole is
left open. It may then be used like any other vinegar.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">398. TO MAKE GINGER BEER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Take of good Jamaica ginger, 2½&#160;oz.<br>
Moist sugar, 3&#160;lbs.<br>
cream of tartar, 1&#160;oz.<br>
the juice and peel of 2 middling sized lemons,<br>
brandy ½ pint,<br>
good solid ale yeast, ¼ pint,<br>
water, 3½ gallons.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This will produce 4½ dozen of excellent ginger beer,
which will keep twelve months. Bruise the ginger and
sugar, and boil them for 20 or 25 minutes in the water, slice
the lemon and put it and the cream of tartar into a large
pan; pour the boiling liquor upon them, stir it well round,
and when milk-warm, add the yeast; cover it over, let it remain
two or three days to work, skimming it frequently;
then strain it through a jelly-bag into a cask, add the brandy,
bung down very close, and at the end of a fortnight or three
weeks, draw it off and bottle, and cork very tight; tie the
cork down with twine or wire. If it does not work well at
first, add a little more yeast, but be careful of adding too
much, least it taste of it.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">399. SPRUCE BEER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take, if white is intended, 6&#160;lbs. of sugar; if brown, as
much treacle, and a pot of spruce, and ten gallons of water.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This is also managed in the same way as ginger beer,
except that it should be bottled as soon as it has done working.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">400. BROWN SPRUCE BEER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Pour 8 gallons of cold water into a barrel, and then boiling
8 gallons more, put that in also, add 12&#160;lbs. of molasses,
with about ½&#160;lb. of the essence of spruce; and on its getting
a little cooler, ½ a pint of good ale yeast. The whole being
well stirred or rolled in the barrel, must be left with the
bung out for two or three days; after which the liquor may
be immediately bottled, well corked up, and packed in saw-dust
or sand, when it will be ripe, and fit to drink in a fortnight.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Remember, that it should be drawn off into quart stone
bottles, and wired.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">401. WHITE SPRUCE BEER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">For a cask of six gallons, mix well together ¼&#160;lb. of the
purest essence of spruce, 7&#160;lbs. of loaf-sugar made into a
clarified syrup, and about 1½ gallons of hot water; and when
sufficiently stirred and incorporated; put it into the cask,
and fill up with cold water. Then add about a ¼ of a pint of
good ale yeast, shake the cask well, and let it work for three
or four days: after which, bung it up. In a few days it may
be bottled off after the usual manner, and in a week or ten
days it will be fit for use. If, on bunging it close, about ¼ of
an oz. of isinglass, first dissolved in a little of the warmed
liquor, or in cider, be stirred in, by way of fining, it will
acquire a superior degree of clearness. In proportion to the
coldness of the weather, the quantity of yeast should be increased.
Some, instead of yeast, use ale or beer-grounds
the first time of making, and afterwards the grounds of their
former spruce beer. In warm weather, very little ferment
is requisite.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Take of tartaric acid, ½&#160;oz.<br>
loaf sugar, 3&#160;oz.<br>
essence of lemon, ½ drachm.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Powder the tartaric acid and the sugar very fine, in a
marble or wedgewood mortar, (observe never to use a metal
one) mix them together, and pour the essence of lemon upon
them, by a few drops at a time, stirring the mixture after
each addition, till the whole is added, then mix them
thoroughly, and divide it into twelve equal parts, wrapping
each up separately in a piece of white paper. When wanted
for use, it is only necessary to dissolve it in a tumbler of
cold water, and fine lemonade will be obtained, containing
the flavour of the juice and peel of the lemon, and ready
sweetened.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">407. TO MAKE CHOCOLATE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">To make good chocolate, put the milk and water on to boil;
then scrape the chocolate fine, from one to two squares to a
pint, to suit the stomach: when the milk and water boils,
take it off the fire; throw in the chocolate; mill it well,
and serve it up with the froth; which process will not take
5 minutes. The sugar may either be put in with the scraped
chocolate or added afterwards.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">It should never be made before it is wanted; because
heating again injures the flavour, destroys the froth, and
separates the body of the chocolate; the oil of the nut being
observed, after a few minutes’ boiling, or even standing
long by the fire, to rise to the top, which is the only cause
this chocolate can offend the most delicate stomach.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">408. TO MAKE COFFEE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">To have coffee <i>in perfection</i>, it should be made from the
best production, carefully roasted, and after cooling for
a few minutes, reduced to powder, and immediately infused;
the tincture will then be of a superior description. But for
common use, the coffee of our own plantations is, in general,
of very good quality.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In England, too little powder of the berry is commonly
given. It requires about one small cup of coffee-powder to
make four cups of tincture for the table. This is at the rate
of an ounce of good powder to four common coffee-cups.
When the powder is put in the bag, as many cups of boiling
water is poured over it as may be wanted.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Pour a pint of boiling water on an ounce of coffee; let
it boil five or six minutes, then pour out a cupful two or
three times, and return it again; put two or three isinglass
slips into it; or a lump or two of fine sugar; boil it five
minutes longer, set the pot by the fire to keep hot for ten
minutes, and the coffee will be beautifully clear. A hot
cream should always be served with coffee. For foreigners,
or those who like it extremely strong, make only eight
dishes from three ounces. If not fresh roasted, lay it before
a fire till hot and dry; or put the smallest bit of fresh
butter into a preserving-pan, when hot throw the coffee into
it, and toss it about till it be freshened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span></p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;" id="THE_COOK">THE COOK.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> her first going into a family the Cook
will do well to inform herself of the rules and
regulations of the house,—the customs of the
kitchen,—the peculiarities of her master and
mistress,—and above all, she must study, most
sedulously, to acquire a perfect knowledge of
their <span class="smcap">taste</span>; which, when attained, will most
probably lead to her permanent establishment
in the sovereignty of the kitchen.</p>

<p>She will enter into all the economical plans
of her employers, and endeavour to make the
most of every thing, as well for the sake of
her own character as for their interest. Not
forgetting, that “wilful waste makes woful
want.”</p>

<p>She will consider the encomiums of her
master and mistress as her highest praise, and
will accept even their admonitions as pleasing
proofs of their desire to make her useful to
themselves, and to enhance her own confidence
and consequence.</p>

<p>The presidency of the kitchen being a situation
of great trust and responsibility, she
will best evince her sense of the confidence
reposed in her by her anxiety to please, and
a sedulous regard to the health and comforts
of the family, which are, necessarily, in her
keeping; governing her whole conduct by
that most excellent moral maxim “Do unto
others as you would they should do unto you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span></p>

<p>To be well qualified for every situation, the
Cook must not only understand the business
of the kitchen, but must be a good judge of
provisions, as in many families, where there
is no housekeeper, she will be required to go
to market. She must also be able to keep an
account of the current expenses of the family;
and to examine, check, and pay the
tradesmen’s bills, which she will have to settle
with her mistress weekly, or when required.</p>

<p>The Cook should give directions to her assistants
to <i>rise early</i>, particularly when a great
dinner is to be dressed, that so every thing
may be got quite ready in the kitchen to begin
business as early in the morning as possible;
else, nine times out of ten, the dinner
will be too late: and it must always be recollected
that “things done in a hurry are never
well done,” and that, “an hour lost in the
morning may be run after the whole day, but
never overtaken.” Besides, to have every thing
properly dressed, and to be punctual, as to
time, with the dinner, will afford great satisfaction
to her employers, and do credit both
to them and to herself. Having learnt the
precise time of dinner, she must not fail to be
<i>punctual</i>.</p>

<p>Cleanliness, in every branch of domestic
concerns cannot be too forcibly inculcated,
and in the business of a Cook, particularly, it
becomes a <span class="smcap">cardinal virtue</span>. Cleanliness and
neatness of person and dress are not less important
in her than the arrangement of the
kitchen and larder, and all her operations.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Boiling.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> boilers, saucepans, and other vessels,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
to be used for culinary purposes, must be kept
perfectly clean and well tinned. <span class="smcap">Block tin</span>
saucepans, &amp;c. are safest, and perhaps best
for these purposes.—When washed they should
be dried by the fire, before they are put away;
and they should always be wiped out again,
with a clean dry cloth, immediately before
they are used. This is to be done chiefly to
prevent rust, and its baleful effects.</p>

<p>Poultry, and every kind of meat, both fresh
and salted, should be washed and wiped dry,
and then dredged well with flour, before it be
put into the boiler, or pot; this will prevent
its being soiled in the water, and will, also,
prevent its looking greasy, when taken up.</p>

<p>Meat must always be put into <i>cold</i> water,
with <i>just enough water to cover it</i>; say, about
a quart of water to a pound of meat,—and it
must be kept <i>so covered</i>, during the whole
process of dressing, by adding boiling water
occasionally.—By this method the inside will
always be heated thoroughly, and be properly
swollen, before the outside becomes hard; and
the whole will be regularly done. This will,
also, occasion the meat to look plump; and
veal and poultry, in particular, will be the
whiter and the better for it.</p>

<p>Beef loses about one-fourth, and mutton
about one-fifth, in boiling.</p>

<p>A moderate fire must be kept up under the
pot, increasing the heat <i>gradually</i>, till it boils,
when it must be drawn back, kept close covered,
and <i>constantly simmering, quite gently</i>,
but by no means boiling fast. A tea-spoonful
of salt thrown into the water, before it
boils, will cause the scum to rise the better,
which must be very carefully skimmed clean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
off, immediately; and if, afterwards, a little
cold water be thrown in, more scum will be
cast up, which must frequently be taken
off, <i>as it rises</i>, as on this alone depends the
good appearance of all boiled articles.</p>

<p>Remember—that water cannot possibly be
made <i>hotter</i> than it is when it first boils; it is,
therefore, a waste of firing, and very detrimental
to the meat to make it boil <i>fast</i>, as it
is thereby rendered hard, and its juices and
finest flavour are evaporated in steam.</p>

<p>Generally, beef, mutton, and lamb, unless the
joints are very thin, or small, require boiling
from a quarter of an hour to eighteen minutes
to a pound; lamb, veal, and pork, and <i>thick</i>
joints also, of whatever kind, require somewhat
longer, especially in <i>cold</i> weather, or
when <i>fresh</i> killed. A large leg of pork, for
instance, will take a little more time;—always
reckoning from the time of its first coming to
boil, and taking into the account that the pot
must <i>always be kept gently simmering;—the
slower the better, so that it be kept boiling</i>.
If you suffer boiled meats to remain in the pot
after they are done, they become soddened
and lose their flavour.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Examples in Boiling.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent"><i>A Round of Beef.</i>—After it has been carefully salted, and
has lain in the pickle eight or ten days, wash it and wipe it
dry; then cut out the bone, and skewer and tie it up tight
and quite round. As soon as the pot boils skim it clean, and
keep it boiling very gently, till done. The time will be according
to its weight. Garnish with slices of carrot and
turnip.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">A LEG OF PORK.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">If large, after it has been in salt eight or ten days, let it
lie in cold water half an hour to make it white—weigh it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
let it boil gently, allowing twenty minutes for every pound—skim
it as soon as it boils, and often afterwards.—A small
Leg of Pork is most delicate.—The liquor will make excellent
peas-soup. Serve it up with peas-pudding and turnips.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">A LEG OF MUTTON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Put it in warm water for ten minutes, and wash it clean,
then put it into the pot and cover it with water—let it <i>simmer
very gently</i> and skim it carefully. A leg of ten pounds
will take two and a half or three hours. Mutton, to be tender,
should hang as long as it will keep.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">A TURKEY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take a hen bird, pick nicely, singe, wash, draw the sinews
of the thighs, and truss it. Make a stuffing of bread, herbs,
salt, pepper, nutmeg, lemon-peel, a few oysters, or an anchovy,
a bit of butter, some suet, and an egg, put this into
the crop, fasten up the skin, and skim the pot most carefully
to make it white. Serve with oyster sauce made rich with
butter, a little cream, and a spoonful of soy or parsley and
butter. Tongue, ham, or pickled pork, are the usual accompaniments.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">A FOWL.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The legs, for boiling, should not be black.—Pick nicely,
wash, singe, truss, and flour it—put it into boiling water,
and <i>simmer gently</i>. A middling fowl will take forty minutes.
Serve with parsley and butter, oyster, lemon, liver, or celery
sauce.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Neither parsley and butter, liver and parsley, celery,
onion, caper, curry, nor other sauce should be poured over
boiled meats, but sent up separately in a boat.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">VEGETABLES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">All vegetables are best when fresh from the garden,—when
dead they are useless. They are also in the greatest
perfection when in the greatest plenty;—unripe vegetables
are unwholesome.</p>
</div>


<p class="p1"><i>Greens</i> must be carefully picked, neatly trimmed,
washed <i>quite clean</i> from vermin, and laid
on a cullender to drain. Then, having ready a
well-tinned saucepan, with plenty of clean,
soft, boiling water, into which some salt has
been thrown, and the scum taken off, plunge
them into it, boil them <i>quickly</i>, watch them,
and keep continually pressing them under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
water with a fork as they rise; and when they
begin to sink of themselves, they are done,
and must be taken up instantly, and drained
dry; for if over done, they will lose not only
their crispness and beautiful appearance, but
their flavour also. Cabbages, savoys, and
turnip-tops, require that the water should be
changed when <i>half done</i>, the second water
should be boiling, and if managed as above
directed, they will eat much the milder and
sweeter for it. <i>This is the whole art of dressing
vegetables to look green and eat well.</i> We
therefore deprecate the use of those factitious
and filthy expedients recommended by some,
and practised by many, to give, as they pretend,
a <i>good colour</i>, to boiled vegetables. <i>This
is the best way</i>;—and all artificial means ought
to be avoided, as unnecessary and pernicious.</p>

<p>Esculent <i>roots</i> of all kinds may be set on
to boil in cold water.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Fish.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fish</span>, particularly if large, must be put into
cold water, with plenty of salt; when ready,
it will part from the bone; or it may be tried
with a fork, and must be taken out of the
water the moment it is done.</p>

<p>If not immediately wanted, let it stay on
the fish-plate, over the hot water, and throw
over it a clean cloth, dipped in boiling water,
to preserve its colour.</p>

<p>A sliced cod should be stewed fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>In all cases, dinner should be served up as
soon as possible after it is ready, because keeping
the boiled articles, particularly fish, in hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
water, renders them vapid and heavy; and
hot closets, covers, and other means used to
keep them hot, dry the juices and make them
eat strong and rancid.</p>

<p>Neither fish, nor vegetables of any kind,
(except ripe potatoes,) should be boiled by
steam.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Elements of Roasting.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleanliness</span> must ever be the <i>maxim</i> for
the kitchen.</p>

<p>Before the spit is drawn from the meat, let
it be wiped clean, and when done with, let it
be rubbed with a little sand and water.</p>

<p>A good brisk fire, due time, proper distance,
and frequent basting, are the chief points to
be attended to in roasting.</p>

<p>Much depends on the fire;—it should always
be <i>brisk</i> and glowing, clear at the bottom,
and suited to the article to be roasted.</p>

<p>Beef and mutton lose about one-third in
roasting.</p>

<p>The ashes should be taken up, and the
hearth made quite clean, before you begin to
roast. If the fire require to be stirred during
the operation, the dripping-pan must be drawn
back, so that then, and at all times, it may be
kept clean from cinders and dust.—Hot cinders,
or live coals, dropping into the pan,
make the dripping rank, and spoil it for
basting.</p>

<p>Beef requires a strong, steady fire, which
should be made up a little time previous to
its being wanted. If the meat has been hung
up some time, the dry outside parts must be
pared off, and it must be basted, first, with a
little salt and water, then well dredged with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
flour, and afterwards basted, continually, with
the dripping; but, if the meat be frozen, it
must be brought into the kitchen several hours
before it is dressed.—Large joints should be
kept at a good distance from the fire at
first, and gradually brought nearer and nearer;—the
average distance for a large joint, at a
good fire, may be about ten or twelve inches,
an inch or two more or less, according to circumstances:
when kitchen paper, dipped in
the dripping, must be tied, not skewered, over
the fat parts, to prevent their being scorched.
When nearly ready, the smoke will draw from
the meat towards the fire; at which time the
paper must be taken off, and the meat must be
put nearer to the fire to <i>brown</i> it; it must also
be sprinkled with a little salt, and well dredged
again, with flour, to froth it.</p>

<p>It is as necessary to <i>roast slowly</i> as to <i>boil
slowly</i>;—and the <i>General Rule</i> is to <i>allow
full a quarter of an hour to a pound for roasting</i>
with a proper fire, under ordinary circumstances,
and with frequent basting. But neither
beef nor mutton require to be so well done as
pork, lamb, and veal.—Pork, in particular, requires
to be thoroughly done. It must be basted
with salt and water; and the skin or rind of
the leg, loin, and spare-rib, must be scored,
with a sharp knife, after it has been some
time at the fire, to make it eat the better.
Geese, pigs, and young pork, require a brisk
fire, and should be turned quickly.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken in spitting the
meat, that the prime part of the joint be
not injured:—to balance it on the spit, cook-holds
and loaded skewers are very handy.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">bottle jack</span> is an excellent substitute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
for a spit, <i>in small families</i>, and for want of
that, ten or a dozen yards of worsted, folded to
a proper length, will answer the purpose very
well. Meat if <i>hung</i> to be roasted, should have
its ends changed when about half done. A
good meat skreen, lined with tin, should always
be set before the fire when roasting; it
keeps off the cold air, renders the heat more
equable, and saves coals.</p>

<p>After all, the above <i>General Rule</i> is liable
to many exceptions. If the meat be <i>fresh
killed</i>, or the weather be <i>cold</i>, a good joint will
require half an hour longer than if the meat
be <i>tender</i> and the weather <i>temperate</i> or <i>warm</i>.</p>

<p>We give the following particulars as a more
certain guide to the Cook, in most cases on this
important point.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Beef.</span>—<i>A Sirloin</i> of about sixteen pounds, will take three
hours and a half or four hours.</p>

<p><i>Ribs of Beef</i>, of nearly the same weight, being thinner,
will require half an hour less.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mutton.</span>—<i>A Leg</i> of eight or nine pounds, will take about
two hours.</p>

<p><i>A Loin or Neck</i>, from an hour and a half to an hour and
three quarters.</p>

<p><i>A Breast</i>, an hour and a quarter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Veal</span> requires to be managed as beef.</p>

<p><i>A Fillet</i>, of fourteen or sixteen pounds, will take five
hours.</p>

<p>(It must be placed at a distance from a strong fire <i>at first</i>,
in order to be thoroughly soaked)</p>

<p><i>A good Loin</i>, will take full three hours.</p>

<p><i>A Breast</i>, from an hour and a half to two hours.</p>

<p><i>A Hind-quarter</i>, of eight pounds, about two hours.</p>

<p><i>A Fore-quarter</i>, of ten pounds, about two hours.</p>

<p><i>A Leg or Loin</i>, about an hour and a quarter.</p>

<p><i>A Breast</i>, three quarters of an hour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pork</span>, as it must be well soaked and well done, requires
longer time, in proportion, than any other meat.</p>

<p><i>A Hare</i> will require an hour, at the least, and care must
be taken that both ends be done enough. It should be well
basted; first, with a pint of milk, or salt and water, then
floured and basted with butter; when half done, it should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
be cut between the shoulders and the neck, to let out the
blood.</p>

<p><i>A large Turkey</i>, will require two hours roasting.</p>

<p><i>A smaller one</i>,—one hour and a half.</p>

<p><i>A small one</i>,—one hour and a quarter.</p>

<p><i>A Goose</i>,—one hour.</p>

<p><i>A large Fowl</i>,—about three quarters of an hour.</p>

<p><i>A middle sized Fowl</i>,—thirty or forty minutes.</p>

<p><i>A Capon</i>,—thirty or thirty-five minutes.</p>

<p><i>A Duck</i>,—twenty or thirty minutes.</p>

<p><i>A small Fowl or Chicken</i>,—twenty minutes.</p>

<p><i>A Partridge</i>,—twenty or twenty-five minutes.</p>

<p><i>A Turkey Poult</i>,—twenty minutes.</p>

<p><i>A Pheasant</i>,—fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><i>Wild Ducks, or Grouse</i>,—fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><i>Pigeons</i>,—fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><i>Quails</i>, and <i>small Birds</i>,—ten minutes.</p>

<p><i>Tame</i> Fowls require more roasting than <i>wild</i> ones.</p>

<p><i>Poultry</i> should not be dressed in less than four days.</p>

<p>All fowls must be well washed, and singed when put down
to the fire, and they must be kept well basted with butter.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Examples in Roasting.</i></p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">A SIRLOIN OF BEEF.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Wipe it clean and dry, and tie paper over the fat parts
to preserve them. Baste it immediately with dripping, and
frequently afterwards. Within the last half hour, sprinkle
it with a little salt, baste it with butter, and dredge it with
flour, and as soon as the froth has risen, dish it up. Garnish
with horse-radish, scraped fine. If it weigh 15&#160;lbs. or
16&#160;lbs. it will require nearly four hours.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">THE RIBS, OR OTHER JOINTS OF BEEF.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Must be roasted in the same way. If fifteen or twenty
lbs. they will take three hours and a half, more or less according
to circumstances.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">LEG, SHOULDER, LOIN OR NECK OF MUTTON.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let it be well basted and frothed in the same manner as
directed for the <i>Sirloin of Beef</i>. The time and dressing
will be according to its weight.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">A LOIN OF VEAL.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Will take about three hours roasting. Paper the kidney,
fat, and back, to preserve them.—Some will have it sent up
with a toast to be eaten with the delicate fat of the kidney;
brown it, and pour good melted butter over it. Garnish
with slices of lemon and force-meat balls.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">LAMB.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>The Hind-quarter.</i>—The leg and loin are best dressed
together; baste and froth it as directed for beef. Serve it up
with green mint-sauce and a salad.</p>

<p>The <i>Leg</i>, <i>Shoulder</i>, <i>Ribs</i>, <i>Loin</i>, <i>Neck</i>, and <i>Breast</i> are all to
be dressed, and served up, in the same way.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">FOWLS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Turkeys</i> and <i>Fowls</i> are to be roasted by a clear brisk fire,
in the same way as each other, only allowing time according
to their size. In drawing Poultry care must be taken not to
break the gall-bag. The sinews of the thighs of Turkeys
and large Fowls should be pulled out, and they should be
trussed with the legs outward.—Wash well, dry, singe, extract
the plugs, and dredge before roasting.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">A GOOSE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Stuff the <i>Goose</i> with onion, sage, pepper, and salt, fasten
it tight at the neck and rump, and then set it down to the
fire, at first, at some distance, bringing it nearer by degrees.—Paste
a slip of paper over the breast-bone, and when the
breast is rising, take it off. Send a good gravy up in the
dish; but first take a table-spoonful of made mustard,
half a tea-spoonful of cayenne pepper, and three spoonsful
of port wine; mix and pour it hot into the body of the
goose, by a slit in the apron: this will wonderfully improve
the stuffing, and is, as Dr. Hunter says, a secret worth
knowing.</p>

<p><i>All poultry must be nicely drawn, picked, the plugs removed,
and the hair carefully singed off with white paper, and then well
washed and dried.</i></p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Baking.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> do not much approve of baking butcher’s-meat,
as a substitute for roasting it,
though it cannot be denied that some articles
may be baked to answer nearly as well as if
roasted; and when a great dinner is to be prepared
it may be convenient to send a dish or
two to the oven, but over these the cook can
have no controul, and must, therefore, depend
entirely on the baker. The following are articles
that may with most advantage be baked,
provided the meat be good and fat, and the
baker be very attentive:—A sucking-pig,
goose, some joints of beef, leg and shoulder of
mutton, leg and loin of pork, fillet of veal,
ham, hare, sprats, and other small kinds of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
fish in pans, or jugs. To poor families, however,
the oven affords great convenience as well
as a considerable saving of expense and trouble.</p>

<p>Beef loses about one third of its weight by
baking.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">A SUCKING PIG.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Let it be prepared as for roasting; fasten buttered paper
on its tail and ears to prevent their being scorched; and
send with it a little butter, tied up in a bit of cloth, to baste
its back with, occasionally, which the baker must be requested
to do.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Broiling.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> this operation let the fire be <i>brisk</i> and
<i>clear</i>. The bars of the gridiron must be bright
at top and clean betwixt; wipe the gridiron
quite clean with a cloth, make its bars hot,
and rub them with nice mutton suet, before
you lay on the meat. Set the gridiron slanting
over the fire, to prevent the fat dropping into
it so as to occasion a smoke, which must be
prevented. We shall give as an example in
this branch of cookery,</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">A RUMP STEAK.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The steak should be cut from the middle of the rump,
must be about half an inch thick, and have been kept till
tender. Broil it <i>quick</i>, and turn it often, with steak-tongs,
to keep in the gravy and make it a nice brown; it will be
done in fifteen or twenty minutes. Having ready, before
the fire, a warm dish, with a table-spoonful of catsup, and a
little minced shallot or onion, lay the steak on it, rub it over
with a little butter, and garnish the dish with pickles and
horse-radish scraped fine.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Frying.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frying</span> is, in fact, <i>boiling in fat</i>. Before
you begin to fry, rub the inside of the Frying-pan
with a little fat, warm it and wipe it
out with a cloth, quite clean.—To fry fish, half
fill the pan with fat, olive oil, nice fresh lard,
clarified drippings, or beef or mutton suet;—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
whatever fat be used let it be perfectly
sweet, free from salt, and nice and clean.
Keep a <i>brisk</i> fire, and make the fat <i>very hot</i>,
which may be known by its having done hissing.
When ready, carefully drain it quite dry
before the fire.</p>

<p>We give the following as an example of <i>the
best method of Frying</i> <span class="smcap">soles</span>, <i>and most other
kinds of fish</i>:</p>

<p>Let them be quite fresh, and some time before
you dress them, wash them thoroughly,
and wipe them with a clean cloth, quite dry.—If
to be fried with bread-crumbs, beat up an
egg, the white and yolk together, quite well,
dip the fish in the egg, and cover them completely
with grated crumbs, and if you wish
the fish to look still better, do them twice
over with egg. The fish, if large, may be
cut into pieces, the proper size for the table,
otherwise they may be fried whole; when cut
they must be dished up as if whole. Let the
fat in the pan be sufficient to cover the fish,
and when it <i>quite boils</i>, and begins to smoke,
put in the fish; it will be nicely browned in
about five minutes, when it should be turned,
and fried just as long on the other side. When
done lay them on a soft cloth, before the fire,
and turn them every two or three minutes, till
they are perfectly dry on both sides.</p>

<p>The fat in which any thing is fried will serve
to fry the same kind of thing several times.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Broths, Soups, Stock, &amp;c.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cleanliness</span> in this, as in every department
of kitchen business, must ever be held as the
<i>leading principle</i>, and will contribute most to
the satisfaction of all parties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span></p>

<p>An economical Cook, when she boils animal
food, will make a rule to convert the liquor, or
broth, into some sort of <i>soup</i> or <i>stock</i>, which
may be done at her leisure, and by which
means she will always have <i>a rich kitchen</i>, as
it is technically called, and will be able to
make an <i>extra dish</i>, or an additional tureen of
soup, at a short notice, and at a trifling expense.
The fragments of meat left after dinner,
with the trimmings of undressed meat
and game, the heads, necks, gizzards, and feet
of fowls, &amp;c. when picked and washed clean,
will help to enrich <i>soups</i>, or make <i>stock</i>, and
save much expense in gravy meat. The <i>broths</i>,
if saved in separate pans, will assist in making
white or brown soups, and the gravies left in
the dishes after dinner, will be good in <i>hashes</i>,
or, with some trifling ingredients added, will
make sauce for fish, goose, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The liquor of a knuckle of veal may be converted
into <span class="smcap">glaze</span>, if boiled with a knuckle of
ham, till reduced to a fourth or a third part,
with the necessary herbs and spices added.</p>

<p><i>To prepare Soups, &amp;c.</i>—the first care of the
Cook will be to see that the stew-pan to be
used is well tinned, scalded, and wiped out perfectly
clean and dry. She will put some butter
or marrow into the bottom of the pan,
then lay in a leg or shin of beef with the bones
well broken, and the meat cut to pieces; or
the skirts of beef, the kidney or melt, or the
shank bones of mutton, well cleaned, with the
fragments and trimmings of meat and other
articles, as above mentioned;—these she will
cover close and keep over a <i>slow fire</i> an hour,
stirring it up, occasionally, from the bottom,
and taking great care that it does not burn.—When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
all the virtues of the meats are extracted,
and the juices are again absorbed by
them, she will add water enough to cover
them, which will be in the proportion of about
a quart of water to a pound of meat, for soup,
and to two pounds, for gravies; the scum must
then be carefully taken off, <i>quite clean</i>, as it
rises, after it has boiled; for the more soups
and broths are skimmed, the better, and more
transparent they will be: and this transparency,
combined with their uniformity of taste,
constitutes their chief excellence. It is important
that the soup be kept <i>gently simmering</i>
five or six or more hours, and that then
be added a scraped carrot, a head of celery, a
couple of onions, two turnips, and a few sweet
herbs;—when ready, let it be strained carefully
through a clean tamis, previously dipped in
cold water, into stone or unglazed earthen
pans, and let the fat remain upon it, to preserve
it, till wanted.</p>

<p>Soups and broths when done, ought not to
be covered, nor put away with vegetables in
them.</p>

<p>Use <i>soft</i> water to boil white peas, and let
the peas be whole; but <i>pump</i> water will make
green peas-soup of a better colour.</p>

<p>A good tureen of peas-soup may be made
from the liquor of pork, mutton, or beef.</p>

<p>The lean of hams or gammon of bacon
should be used when <i>Stock</i> is made; but if the
former, first give it a boil in water, before you
put it in, else it will turn the soup red.</p>

<p>The <i>sediment</i> of gravies, &amp;c. that have stood
to be cold, should never be used.</p>

<p>A clear jelly of cow-heels makes a great improvement
to gravies and soups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span></p>

<p>A lump of clarified butter, thoroughly mixed
with flour and boiled with the soup will
give it a richness and a greater consistency, if
required.—A little tarragon added, just before
it is served up, will give it an agreeable flavour.</p>

<p>All soups should be sent to table quite hot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cullis</span>, or <i>brown gravy</i>, is made with lean
veal and ham or gammon, and sweet herbs, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bechamel</span>, or <i>white sauce</i>, is made in the
same way, but is not browned; it must be improved
by the addition of equal quantities of
good broth and thick cream simmered with it
half an hour, before it is strained off.</p>

<p>The articles used in thickening, seasoning,
and flavouring broths and soups, are chiefly
bread, flour, oatmeal, peas, rice, Scotch and
pearl-barley, isinglass, maccaroni, turnips,
beet, carrots, mushrooms, garlick, onions,
shallots, cress, parsley, thyme, sage, mint, and
other sweet and savoury herbs; also allspice,
cinnamon, cloves, mace, nutmeg, ginger, pepper,
lemon-juice, essence of anchovies, &amp;c.
these combined with wine and mushroom
catsup, form an endless variety for flavouring
and seasoning broths and soups.</p>

<p>Basil, savoury, and knotted-marjorum, are
very pungent, and should be used cautiously.</p>

<p>No Cook can support the credit of her
kitchen without having plenty of <i>gravy</i>, <i>cullis</i>,
and <i>stock</i> always at hand, as <i>these are the
bases of all soups and high-seasoned dishes</i>.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Sauces and Gravies.</i></p>

<p>These are simple, and easily made.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">GRAVY FOR ROAST MEAT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Almost every joint will afford trimmings enough to make
plain gravy for itself, which may be heightened with a little
browning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span></p>

<p>Or, half an hour before the meat is done, mix a little salt
and boiling water, and drop it on the brown parts of the
meat, which catch in something under, and set it by to cool;
when the meat is ready, remove the fat, warm the gravy,
and pour it into the dish.</p>

<p>Or, the brown bits of roasted or broiled meat, infused a
night in boiling water, and the next day just boiled up, and
drained off, will make a good gravy.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">GRAVY FOR BOILED MEAT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Make it of the trimmings and paring of the meat.</p>

<p>Or pour as much of the liquor as may be necessary into
the dish, and pierce the meat, on the under part, with a
skewer.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">MELTED BUTTER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Cut two ounces of butter into small pieces, and put it into
a pint saucepan, with a large tea-spoonful of flour, and two
table-spoonsful of milk; when thoroughly mixed, add six
table-spoonsful of water, shake it continually, over the fire,
always the same way, till it simmers, then set it on, and let
it just boil up, when it will be about the thickness of cream:
if too thick to eat with vegetables, add a little more milk.</p>

<p><i>This is the foundation of almost all the sauces.</i></p>

<p>Two table-spoonsful of mushroom catsup added to this
instead of the milk, will make an excellent sauce for <i>fish</i>,
<i>flesh</i>, or <i>fowl</i>, and particularly for <i>chops</i> and <i>steaks</i>.</p>

<p>If butter be oiled in melting, put in a spoonful of cold water
and stir it with a spoon; or pour it forward and backward
from the saucepan to the boat, till it is come again.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">LEMON SAUCE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Pare a lemon, cut it into thick slices, and divide these into

<p><span class="smcap">All plain sauces</span>, should taste only of the
articles from which they take their names.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">compound sauces</span> the several ingredients
should be so nicely proportioned that
no particular flavour should predominate.</p>

<p>Soy, walnut-peels, burnt treacle, or sugar,
cayenne pepper, or capsicums, chilies, vinegar,
pickled herrings, anchovies, sardinias, or sprats,
are the bases of almost all the sauces to be
found in the shops.</p>

<p>Never season too highly your sauces, gravies,
or soups.</p>

<p>Cloves and allspice,—mace and nutmeg,—marjorum,
thyme, and savory,—leeks, onions,
shalots, and garlic,—need not be mixed together
in the same preparation, when either of
them will supply the place of the others.</p>

<p>In short, Cooks now know, by experience,
that a much less number of ingredients are
sufficient to give a finer flavour to sauces, &amp;c.
than was formerly used; because, in this age
of refined taste, we have learnt to combine
the <i>simply elegant</i> with the <i>purely nutritious</i>.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Salads.</i></p>

<p>These may be eaten at all seasons of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
year; but they are most wholesome in the
spring, when green herbs, of all kinds, are in
the greatest perfection. They are, then, most
efficacious, in cleansing, sweetening, and purifying
the blood. But, though Salads in the
winter act not so powerful as in the spring,
yet, such as are to be had, retain all the properties
or qualities of their nature, and the
warmer kinds, in particular, being gentle,
salutary, and most excellent stimulants, are
well calculated to warm the stomach, and
exhilarate the spirits.</p>

<p>Salad herbs should be used fresh from the
gardens; but if grown stale, they must be
refreshed in cold water. They must be carefully
picked, and washed clean, and then shaken

<p>The adulteration of articles of provision is
now so common, that the Cook will do well
to be guarded against such impositions, by dealing
with respectable tradesmen only.—The
articles most frequently adulterated are bread,
tea, brown sugars, coffee, mustard, pepper,
and all other things that are to pass through
the mill.</p>

<p>The Cook should take care to be amply provided
with proper instruments, and kitchen
utensils of all kinds, without which she can
do nothing as it ought to be done. It will
be necessary to have graduated glass measures,
such as the apothecaries use, divided into tea-spoonsful
and table-spoonsful,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and also graduated
on their sides, according to the following
figures, in order to measure quantities
of fluids with accuracy.</p>

in, trim it neatly and carefully, by cutting out all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
the bloody parts and the fly-blowings, if any;
cut out also the kernels in the thick end of the
sirloin, in the fat of the rump, in the pope’s-eye,
the thick fat of the buttock, and wherever
else they are to be found. Cut off the skirt
under the ribs, and as much of the suet from
the sirloin and rump as will leave them handsome
for dressing. Cut off also the spare suet
in the loins of veal and mutton; and the spare
fat of necks, or loins of mutton, makes much
lighter puddings than suet. Be careful also to
take out the pipe which runs along the chine-bone,
and the pith which is in the back-bone in
the sirloin, rump, &#038;c.; the whole should then
be wiped dry, all the holes filled up with salt,
and the roasting pieces should be sprinkled
with salt and hung up till wanted. In winter,
the boiling meat, that is frozen, should be
soaked in cold water, two or three hours before
it is dressed; but the best way to thaw a
roasting joint is to let it be in the warm kitchen
several hours before it is put to the fire.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold">SALTING.</p>

<p>The boiling pieces, if the weather permit, will
be the better for hanging a day or two before
they are salted. In warm weather, it is best
to let them lie an hour, rubbing well every
part that is likely to be fly-blown, and then
wiping them dry with a cloth, and having salt
ready, rub it into every part, taking care
to fill the holes where the kernels and skewers
have been. Turn them and rub them well
with the pickle every day, and in three or four
days they will be fit to dress, if wanted. Wash
all the boiling pieces before dressing; and its
colour will be the better for soaking; but never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
wash roasting joints before they are dressed, as
it robs them of their best juices and finest
flavour; it is, therefore, much better to wipe
them well with a dry cloth, and pare off the
dry parts on the outside.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>General Business of the</i> <span class="smcap">Larder</span>.</p>

<p>Joints of meat, game, &amp;c. should be hung
where there is a current of dry air, till they are
tender. If they be not kept long enough, they
will be hard and tough;—if too long, they lose
their flavour. Much loss is sustained by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
spoiling of meat in warm weather; to prevent
which, as far as possible, it must be turned daily,
end for end, and wiped every morning and night,
with a clean, dry cloth, to free it and keep it
from damp and moisture. If it be feared that
any of the ripe meat will not keep till wanted,
it should be parboiled, or part-roasted, by
which means it may be kept a day or two the
longer. Pieces of charcoal should also be put
over meat, and a plug of charcoal put into
the vents of fowls, &amp;c. a string being tied
round their necks. Before dressing meat it must
be well washed and wiped dry; except roasting-beef,
the dry outsides of which must
be pared off. When meat indicates the least
degree of putridity it should be dressed with
out delay, else it becomes unwholesome. In
the latter case, however, even fish, as well as
meat, may be reclaimed, by putting pieces of
charcoal into the water with it, when boiled
or parboiled.—Tainted meat may also be restored
by washing it in cold water, and afterwards
in strong chamomile tea, and rubbing it
dry with a clean cloth; after which it may
be sprinkled with salt, and suffered to remain
till the next day, if necessary.</p>

<p>In frosty weather all meat should be brought
into the kitchen over night, or at least several
hours before it is to be dressed.</p>

<p>Early in the morning remove the cold meat
into clean dishes; change also, all the broths,
soups, gravies, stock, cullis, &amp;c. that require it,
into clean scalded stone-pans; and never leave
any eatables in copper or brass vessels, for if
touched with salt or vinegar, or any acid, and
left wet, they will corrode and gather poison.</p>

<p>Turn and rub the meat that is in salt; after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
which let the Larder be well scoured and
cleaned out.</p>

<p>Dried meats, hams, tongues, bacon, &amp;c.
must be hung up in a cool, dry place, otherwise
they will become rusty.</p>

<p>Bread should be kept in an earthen pan,
with a cover, to exclude the air;—it should not
be cut till it is a day old.</p>

<p>The vigilant Cook, having attended to the
minutiæ of the <span class="smcap">larder</span>, and directed that the
shelves and floor be well scoured and washed,
and every part made perfectly free from smells,
will next, if it be in her department, prepare
to go to market, and consult her mistress or
the housekeeper accordingly.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Having seen that all the marketing is properly
disposed of,—the parlour lunch, nursery
and servants’ dinners getting forward, or got
out of the way, then commences the <i>principal</i>
preparations for the day.</p>

<p>In families where great dinners are seldom
given, it will be better, when it can be conveniently
done, to make an arrangement,
as to the principal dishes, a day or two, or
more, before hand. The Cook should never
quit her post, on such an occasion, as it requires
not only great skill but the utmost attention
and exertion to send up the whole of
a great dinner, with all its accompaniments, in
perfect order.</p>

<p>When there is an opportunity of getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
forward the soups, sauces, and made dishes, on
the preceding day, it should, by all means, be
done; but if not, the soups, &amp;c. should be
forwarded early in the morning, and while
these are preparing, the joints of meat, cutlets,
and other articles should be trimmed, the
poultry and game, &amp;c. trussed and made ready
for dressing; the vegetables picked quite clean,
trimmed, and <i>well</i> washed, and laid separate, in
dishes or cullenders. The shalots, onions,
sweet-herbs, spices, &amp;c. should also be prepared,
and laid quite at hand.</p>

<p>The <i>Bill of Fare</i> being made out, and the
hour of active operation approaching, the clock
must be consulted, and the different articles
prepared and laid to the fire, in succession, according
to the times they will take, that all
may be ready in due time.—A scene of activity
now commences, in which you must necessarily
be cool, collected, and attentive.—Have
an eye to the roast meat, and an ear to the
boils,—and let your thoughts continually recur
to the rudiments of your art, which at
this moment must be called into practical requisition.
You will endeavour that every kind
of vegetable, and of sauce, be made to keep pace
with the dishes to which they respectively belong—so
that all may go up stairs <i>smoking
hot</i> together, and in due order.</p>

<p>Let a clean cloth be laid on the kitchen-table,
and with the <i>bill of fare</i> for your guide, if
neither housekeeper nor the butler be present,
let the dishes, intended to be used, be placed on
this table, exactly as they are meant to stand on
the table in the dining-room, and let every article
be taken off the table in the kitchen, by the
footman, and proper assistants, in regular order,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
by which means the butler cannot fail to
set them in their proper places above stairs.</p>

<p>In some families, the soups are sent up first;
and next, after a few minutes, the fish, then
the removes, vegetables, sauces, and the whole
of the first course:—mean time the <i>entremets</i>,
or second course, will be dished and sent up,
precisely in the same way. This would be
done in all families, at all times, were it not
deemed necessary frequently to sacrifice convenience,
comfort, and every other consideration,
at the shrine of fashion and elegance of
appearance.</p>

<p>When the dinner things are brought down,
the meat must be removed into clean common
dishes; and as many things, such as fricandeaus,
stews, &amp;c. may remain untouched, or
can be made to do again, when tossed up
afresh, in different ways; they must be taken
out of the gravies, the garnish, &amp;c. picked
clean off them, and the meat put by in clean
dishes, and covered with thin slices of bacon.
These gravies, and those from the roast meats
of different kinds, must all be saved in separate
stone pans, as all things of this kind serve to
make a <i>rich kitchen</i>, and may be converted or
applied to various useful purposes. The soups
that are left should be strained through sieves
to take out the bread and other vegetable matters,
which, if left in, would turn them sour.</p>

<p>What sweets are left, such as Blancmange,
Jellies, &amp;c. may be melted and run into smaller
moulds or shapes, and made to do again.
Such management as this is highly commendable
in all families, as thereby you are at all
times provided for <i>extra visiters</i>.</p>

<p>Potted Meats, Collared articles, Anchovies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
Oysters and other shell-fish, mock Brawn,
cold Hams, Tongue, Stewed Peas, Black Caps,
Sweets of various kinds, and some sorts of
Tarts, should also be kept ready for suppers
and <i>extra occasions</i>.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The kitchen fire being <i>reduced</i>, and made
up for ordinary occasions,—The dishes and
every other article that has been used in the
course of the day, and particularly the <i>pots</i>,
<i>kettles</i>, <i>sauce-pans</i>, and other <i>culinary utensils</i>,
being all scoured, and made perfectly clean,
dried, wiped out, and put in their proper
places;—the dressers and tables scoured down,
and the whole kitchen made quite clean and
put into perfect order, the principal business
of the day may be considered at an end, as
little more, of consequence, will seldom be
required on the part of the Cook, except what
further attention the <span class="smcap">larder</span>, in hot weather,
may demand, before she retires.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Useful Hints.</i></p>

<p>With the utmost attention of the Cook, she
can gain no credit, if she send up more than
one dish, with all its accompaniments, at a
time, and that as quickly as possible.</p>

<p><i>Old</i> meats do not require so much dressing
as <i>young</i>, because they may be eaten with the
gravy in them.</p>

<p><i>Pickled pork</i> requires longer dressing, in
proportion, than any other meat.</p>

<p>Hashes and minces should be only <i>simmered</i>,
if boiled, they become hard.</p>

<p>Meat <i>hastily</i> boiled or roasted is, thereby,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
made the more indigestible, and its juices are
wastefully extracted.</p>

<p>The warmer the weather, and the staler the
meat, the less time it will take in dressing.</p>

<p>When meat is <i>overdone</i> it is spoiled, and the
fault can never be corrected;—when neither
<i>overdone</i> nor <i>underdone</i> it is most digestible
and most nutritious;—and when thoroughly
done, it eats short and tender.</p>

<p>In dressing Meats, be as correct as possible
as to quantities, qualities, and time.</p>

<p>Meat that is not to be cut up till cold must
be well done, particularly in the summer time.</p>

<p>The greatest skill of the best cook will avail
nothing, unless the provisions are good.</p>

<p>The present taste is <i>simply to boil both carp
and tench</i>; and serve up with plain or savoury
sauce, or rather, with Dutch sour sauce, which
does not destroy the flavour of the fish.</p>

<p>All fish should be sent up <i>as hot as possible</i>,
and particularly the sauces. In fact, <i>all sauces</i>
ought to be set on the table <i>quite hot</i>.</p>

<p>Essence of anchovies is a very good fish-sauce,
alone—or otherwise.</p>

<p>To prepare meat in a <i>hot-bath</i> is a most excellent
mode of cookery; as it makes it tender
without the loss of its juices.</p>

<p>A conjuror or Papin’s digester is a very economical
Utensil. It will dress a steak deliciously,
with the addition of a little catsup, or
with oysters, &amp;c.—It boils water in a few
minutes.</p>

<p>To keep meat hot, when done, take it up,
set the dish over a pan of boiling water, put a
deep cover over it, and throw a clean cloth
over that.</p>

<p>Broiled beef steaks, mutton-chops, &amp;c.
should always be sent to the table <i>hot and hot</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span></p>

<p>Whole peas are better than split peas for
soup, in winter. It is a good practice to steep
them an hour or more in cold water, before
they are boiled.</p>

<p><i>Wines</i> and <i>spices</i> should not be put into
<i>soups</i>, <i>stews</i>, &amp;c. too early, as the heat evaporates
both the spirit and the flavour.</p>

<p><i>Vermicelli</i>, when used in <i>soups</i>, &amp;c. should
not be suffered to remain in it more than
fifteen minutes, as it will become a paste.</p>

<p>Dripping will do as well as butter to baste
any thing.</p>

<p>A small quantity of cream is better than
flour and water, in melting butter.</p>

<p>Much butter is not to be recommended on
all occasions.</p>

<p>When the palate is become dull by frequent
tasting, wash the mouth with milk;—or
eat an apple.</p>

<p>A bit of bread stuck upon the point of the
knife with which you peel or cut onions, will
prevent their disagreeable effect on the eyes.</p>

<p>A kettle of water kept boiling, over a charcoal
fire, will effectually prevent its deleterious
effects in the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coals.</span> Judicious Cooks will perform their
culinary operations with much less coal than
those who erroneously conceive that the greater
the fire, the greater the dispatch. <i>Time</i>, rather
than a fierce fire, answers <i>best</i> both for
roasting and boiling meats.—Round coals are
best for use, and small coal should never be
thrown on a weak fire, as it will stop the progress
of the air through the fire; and perhaps
extinguish it. But small coal, or culm, a little
wetted, and thrown at the back of a good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
fire, will become cinders or coke, and greatly
improve it.</p>

<p>All the ashes of the kitchen and other grates
should be sifted, and the cinders saved, to be
used under the boilers in brewing and washing,
or in the ironing stove.</p>

<p>A simple and excellent contrivance for
sifting cinders may be purchased at the Ironmongers.</p>

<p>Omelets should be made to eat full and thick
at the mouth. They should be sent up quite
hot, after dinner, and are wholesome, and
great favourites in most countries.</p>

<p>A little sugar much improves the taste of
green peas.</p>

<p>Potted meats make excellent sandwiches.</p>

<p>Sandwiches should be neatly cut in mouthfuls,
so as to be taken up with a fork.</p>

<p>We have now initiated our honest candidate
for culinary fame, by regular and easy gradations,
into the whole <i>arcana</i> of the profession,—taught
her to judge of the natures and qualities
of provisions, and their comparative
values;—the best seasons and methods of purchasing,
and of managing undressed animal
and vegetable food; and the general economy
of the <span class="smcap">larder</span>;—Have given her the plainest
elementary principles and precepts, and a few
of the most simple examples, for practice, in
all the various branches of boiling, roasting,
baking, broiling, frying, &amp;c.—the best methods
of making soups, gravies, sauces, and
salads: and, lastly, the modern mode of preparing
<i>a good dinner, with all its most approved
accompaniments</i>. In fine, we have been anxious,
not only to instruct the common cook
in the rudiments, and all the ordinary operations
of her art, but how to combine, both
in principle and practice, the most elegant
with the most useful results; so as to enable
her to please both the man of taste and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
man of temperance;—the economist and the
epicure;—the whimsical and the wise;—those
who eat to live, and those who live to eat.—Under
the head Housekeeper, we have also
given ample instructions for making <span class="smcap">Pastry</span>,
<span class="smcap">Confectionary</span>, <span class="smcap">Preserves</span>, and <span class="smcap">Pickles</span>,
which frequently fall within the province of
the cook. The whole comprises, as it were
in a nut-shell, a complete compendium of culinary
knowledge, chiefly valuable for its comprehensive
brevity, and which, we trust, will
be found, by the ingenious practitioner, full as
useful as many, more elaborate volumes, professedly
written on this subject <i>only</i>, and
published at not less, if not more than the
whole price of this little Work.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="noindent center p1 bold"><i>Dean Swift’s ironical directions to the Cook.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Although I am not ignorant, that it hath been a long
time since the custom began among people of quality to
keep men cooks, and generally of the <i>French</i> nation; yet
because my treatise is chiefly calculated for the general
run of knights, ’squires, and gentlemen both in town and
country, I shall therefore apply to you, Mrs. Cook, as a
woman; however, a great part of what I intend may serve
for either sex: and your part naturally follows the former;
because the butler and you are joined in interest; your vails
are generally equal, and paid when others are disappointed;
you can junket together at nights upon your own prog, when
the rest of the house are a-bed; and have it in your power to
make every fellow-servant your friend; you can give a good
bit or a good sup to the little masters and misses, and gain
their affections: a quarrel between you is very dangerous
to you both, and will probably end in one of you being
turned off, in which fatal case, perhaps, it will not be so
easy in some time to cotton with another. And now, Mrs.
Cook, I proceed to give you my instructions, which I desire
you will get some fellow-servant in the family to read to you
constantly one night in every week when you are going to
bed; whether you serve in town or country, for my lessons
shall be fitted for both.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>If your lady forgets at supper, that there is any cold meat
in the house, do not you be so officious as to put her in
mind of it; it is plain she did not want it; and if she recollects
it the next day, say she gave you no orders, and it is
spent; therefore, for fear of telling a lie, dispose of it with
the butler, or any other crony, before you go to bed.</p>

<p>Never send up a leg of a fowl at supper, while there is a
cat or a dog in the house, that can be accused for running
away with it: but if there happen to be neither, you must
lay it upon the rats, or a strange hound.</p>

<p>It is ill house-wifery to foul your kitchen rubbers with
wiping the bottoms of the dishes you send up, since the
table-cloth will do as well, and is changed every meal.</p>

<p>Never clean your spits after they have been used; for the
grease left upon them by meat is the best thing to preserve
them from rust; and when you make use of them again,
the same grease will keep the inside of the meat moist.</p>

<p>If you live in a rich family, roasting and boiling are
below the dignity of your office, and which it becomes you
to be ignorant of; therefore leave that work wholly to the
kitchen-maid, for fear of disgracing the family you live in.</p>

<p>If you are employed in marketing, buy your meat as cheap
as you can, but when you bring in your accounts, be tender
of your master’s honour, and set down the highest rate;
which, besides, is but justice, for nobody can afford to sell at
the same rate that he buys, and I am confident that you may
charge safely; swear that you gave no more than what the
butcher and poulterer asked. If your lady orders you to
set up a piece of meat for supper, you are not to understand
that you must set it up all; therefore, you may give
half to yourself and the butler.</p>

<p>Good cooks cannot abide what they justly call fiddling
work, where abundance of time is spent and little done: such,
for instance, is the dressing of small birds, requiring a world
of cookery and clutter, and a second or third spit, which by
the way is absolutely needless; for it will be a very ridiculous
thing indeed, if a spit which is strong enough to turn a
sirloin of beef, should not be able to turn a lark; however,
if your lady be nice, and is afraid that a large spit will tear
them, place them handsomely in the dripping-pan, where
the fat of roasted mutton or beef falling on the birds, will
serve to baste them, and so save both time and butter: for
what cook of any spirit would lose her time in picking
larks, wheat-ears, and other small birds? Therefore, if you
cannot get the maids, or the young misses to assist you, e’en
make short work, and either singe or flay them; there is no
great loss in the skins, and the flesh is just the same.</p>

<p>If you are employed in marketing, do not accept a treat
of a beef-steak and a pot of ale from the butcher, which I
think in conscience is no better than wronging your master;
but do you always take that perquisite in money if you do not
go in trust, or in poundage when you pay the bills.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The kitchen bellows being usually out of order with
stirring the fire with the muzzle to save the tongs and
poker, borrow the bellows out of your lady’s bed-chamber,
which being least used, are commonly the best in the house;
and if you happen to damage or grease them, you have a
chance to have them left entirely for your own use.</p>

<p>Let a blackguard boy be always about the house to
send on your errands, and go to market for you on rainy
days, which will save your clothes, and make you appear
more creditable to your mistress.</p>

<p>If your mistress allows you the kitchen-stuff, in return
for her generosity take care to boil and roast your meat
sufficiently. If she keeps it for her own profit, do her justice,
and, rather than let a good fire be wanting, enliven it now
and then with the dripping, and the butter that happens to
turn to oil.</p>

<p>Send up your meat well stuck with skewers, to make
it look round and plump; and an iron skewer rightly employed
now and then will make it look handsomer.</p>

<p>When you roast a long joint of meat, be careful only
about the middle, and leave the two extreme parts raw,
which may serve another time, and will also save firing.</p>

<p>When you scour your plates and dishes, bend the brim
inwards, so as to make them hold the more.</p>

<p>Always keep a large fire in the kitchen, when there is a
small dinner, or the family dines abroad, that the neighbours,
seeing the smoke, may commend your master’s house-keeping:
but when much company is invited, then be as
sparing as possible of your coals, because a great deal of the
meat, being half raw, will be saved, and serve next day.</p>

<p>Boil your meat constantly in <i>pump</i> water, because you
must sometimes want river or pipe water; and then your
mistress, observing your meat of a different colour, will
chide you when you are not in fault.</p>

<p>When you have plenty of fowls in the larder, leave the
door open, in pity to the poor cat, if she be a good mouser.</p>

<p>If you find it necessary to go to market in a wet day,
take out your mistress’s cloak, to save your clothes.</p>

<p>Get three or four chair-women to attend you constantly
in the kitchen, whom you pay at small charges, only with
the broken meat, a few coals, and all the cinders.</p>

<p>To keep troublesome servants out of the kitchen, always
leave the winder sticking on the jack, to fall on their heads.</p>

<p>If a lump of soot falls into the soup, and you cannot conveniently
get it out, stir it well, and it will give the soup a
high French taste.</p>

<p>If you melt your butter to oil, be under no concern, but
send it up; for oil is a genteeler sauce than butter.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Scrape the bottoms of your pots and kettles with a silver
spoon, for fear of giving them a taste of the copper.</p>

<p>When you send up butter for sauce, be so thrifty as to
let it be half water; which is also much wholesomer.</p>

<p>If your butter, when it is melted, tastes of brass, it is your
master’s fault, who will not allow you a silver saucepan;
besides, the less of it will go the farther, and new tinning is
very chargeable: if you have a silver saucepan, and the
butter smells of smoke, lay the fault upon the coals.</p>

<p>Never make use of a spoon in any thing that you can
do with your hands, for fear of wearing out your master’s
plate.</p>

<p>When you find that you cannot get dinner ready at the
time appointed, put the clock back, and <i>then it may be ready
to a minute</i>.</p>

<p>Let a red-hot coal now and then fall into the dripping-pan;
that the smoke of the dripping may ascend, and give
the roast meat a high taste.</p>

<p>You are to look upon the kitchen as your dressing room;
but you are not to wash your hands, till you have gone to
the Privy, and spitted your meat, trussed your fowl, picked
your salad, nor indeed till after you have sent up your
second course: for your hands will be ten times fouler with
the many things you are forced to handle; but when your
work is over, one washing will serve for all.</p>

<p>There is but one part of your dressing that I would
admit while the victuals are boiling, roasting, or stewing; I
mean, the combing your head, which loseth no time, because
you stand over your cookery, and watch it with one hand,
while you are using the comb with the other.</p>

<p>If any of the combings happen to be sent up with the
victuals, you may safely lay the fault upon any of the footmen
that hath vexed you: as those gentlemen are sometimes
apt to be malicious, if you refuse them a sop in the
pan, or a slice from the spit, much more when you discharge
a ladle-full of hot porridge on their legs, or send them up to
their masters with a dish-clout pinned at their tail.</p>

<p>In roasting and boiling, order the kitchen-maid to bring
none but the large coals, and save the small ones for the fires
above stairs: the first are properest for dressing meat; and
when they are out, if you happen to miscarry in any dish,
you may fairly lay the fault upon the want of coals; besides,
the cinder-pickers will be sure to speak ill of your master’s
house-keeping, where they do not find plenty of large
cinders mixt with fresh large coals: thus you may dress
your meat with credit, do an act of charity, raise the honour
of your master, and sometimes get share of a pot of ale
for your bounty to the cinder-woman.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>As soon as you have sent up the second course, you have
nothing to do (in a great family) until supper: <i>therefore</i> scour
your bands and face, put on your hood and scarf, and take
your pleasure among your cronies, till nine or ten at night—but
dine first.</p>

<p>Let there be always a strict friendship between you and
the butler, for it is both your interests to be united: the
butler often wants a comfortable tit-bit, and you much
oftener a cool cup of good liquor. However, be cautious of
him, for he is sometimes an inconstant lover; because he
hath great advantage to allure the maids with a glass of
sack, or white-wine and sugar.</p>

<p>When you roast a breast of veal, remember your sweet-heart
the butler loves a sweet-bread; therefore set it aside
till evening; you can say, the cat or the dog has run away
with it, or you found it tainted or fly-blown; and besides,
it looks as well at the table without it.</p>

<p>When you make the company wait long for dinner, and
the meat be over-done, which is generally the case, you may
lawfully lay the fault upon your lady, who hurried you to
send up dinner, that you was forced to send it up too much
boiled or roasted.</p>

<p>If your dinner miscarries in almost every dish, how
could you help it? You were teazed by the footmen coming
into the kitchen; and to prove it true, take occasion to be
angry, and throw a ladle-full of broth on one or two of
their liveries; besides <i>Friday</i> and <i>Childermas-day</i> are two
cross days in the week, and it is impossible to have good
luck on either of them; therefore on those two days you
have a lawful excuse.</p>

<p>When you are in haste to take down your dishes, tip
them in such a manner, that a dozen will fall together upon
the dresser, just ready for your hand.</p>

<p>To save time and trouble, cut your apples and onions
with the <i>same knife</i>; well-bred gentry love the taste of an
onion in every thing they eat.</p>

<p>Lump three or four pounds of butter together with your
hand; then dash it against the wall just over the dresser,
so as to have it ready to pull by pieces as you have occasion
for it.</p>

<p>If you have a silver sauce-pan for the kitchen use, let me
advise you to batter it well, and keep it always black; this
will be for your master’s honour; for it shews there has
been constant good house-keeping: and make room for the
sauce-pan by wriggling it on the coals, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the same manner, if you are allowed a large silver spoon
for the kitchen, let half the bowl of it be worn out with
continual scraping and stirring; and often say merrily, this
spoon owes my master no service.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When you send up a mess of broth, water-gruel, or the
like, to your master in a morning, do not forget, with your
thumb and two fingers, to put salt on the side of the plate;
for if you make use of a spoon, or the end of a knife, there
may be danger that the salt would fall, and that would be
a sign of ill luck. Only remember to lick your thumb and
fingers clean, before you offer to touch the salt.</p>
</div>

<p>In this satire, much useful instruction is
conveyed, and many faults exposed which
could not be so well noticed in any other
form. A valuable servant will, of course, not
lay herself open to the Dean’s irony.</p>

<p>Above all things, a cook should avoid all
cruelty, and no custom or usage should be an
excuse for any practices, by which living and
sensitive creatures are to be put to wanton
and unnecessary torture.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">
THE KITCHEN-MAID, <span class="smcap">or</span> UNDER COOK.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Cleanliness</span> must be considered as the <i>first
and leading principle</i> of the kitchen-maid, as
well as of the head cook and all other persons
in any way employed in the business of the
kitchen.</p>

<p>This servant has, in many families, the
hardest place in the house. It is her business,
under the superintendance of the cook, to
take nearly the whole management of roasting,
boiling, and otherwise dressing all plain joints
and dishes, and all the fish and vegetables.—She
is also, if there be no <i>scullion</i>, to keep the
<i>kitchen</i>, <i>larder</i>, <i>scullery</i>, all the <i>kitchen utensils</i>,
and every thing belonging to it perfectly
clean,—in the best possible condition, and
always fit for use. On the due performance
of this important part of her business mainly
depends the credit and character, not of herself
only, but of the cook also; it therefore
behoves the cook to see it properly done.</p>

<p>The kitchen-maid must always rise betimes,
light the kitchen fire, and set on water to be
heated for all the purposes of the family, the
first thing she does.—She next scours the dressers
and shelves, and the kitchen tables, with
soap and sand, and hot water; and cleans up
the kitchen: she then clears out and cleans
the housekeeper’s room, the hall and passages,
the front door, and area steps, the larder,
and the butler’s pantry; in doing which,
the scullion (if there be one kept) takes the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
dirtiest and most laborious part. She then
prepares the breakfasts in the housekeeper’s
room, and the servants’-hall. These things,
if she be active, she will have accomplished
before the cook begins to require her attention
and attendance in the larder, in the
furtherance of the culinary preparations; to
which, however, she must have an eye, even
from her earliest rising, particularly to the
soups and other things, that require a long
time to prepare.</p>

<p>After breakfast, if not before, the cook will
require her assistance in the larder, and afterwards
for the remainder of the day she will
be occupied in the kitchen, under the direction
of the cook; first, in preparing for the
servants’ dinner, the dinner in the nursery, or
elsewhere, and the lunch in the parlour; next
in helping to get ready the family dinner;
then in washing up and clearing away every
thing, and cleaning up the kitchen; and lastly,
in setting out and preparing the supper, either
hot or cold, for the servants.</p>

<p>As the kitchen-maid generally fills her situation
with the view of becoming a cook, at
a future day, it behoves her to read with attention
the foregoing <i>Directions to the Cook</i>,
which contain the rudiments of the art, and
which, if she attentively study, and practically
apply, will enable her to attain such a proficiency
in her business, as will render her a
valuable acquisition to her future employers.
[Wages from 12 to 14 guineas per year.]</p>

<p>Having given a full and adequate sketch of
the theory and leading principles of the culinary
art, and exemplified them in the practical
duties of the cook and kitchen-maid, we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
shall conclude the subject with a brief outline
of the duties of their humble and laborious
assistant,</p>

THE SCULLION, <span class="smcap">or</span> SCULLERY-MAID.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is the business of this servant to light the
fires in the kitchen range, and under the copper
or boilers, and stew-holes—to wash up all
the plates and dishes—scour and clean all the
sauce-pans, stew-pans, kettles, pots, and all
other kitchen utensils; and to take care that
all the latter are <i>always kept clean</i>, <i>dry</i>, and
<i>fit for use</i>. She is to assist the kitchen-maid
in picking, trimming, washing and boiling the
vegetables, cleaning the kitchen and offices,
the servants’-hall, housekeeper’s room, and
steward’s room; and to clean the steps of the
front door and the area. She makes the beds
for the stable men—and generally fetches, carries,
and clears away for the cook and kitchen-maid,
and otherwise assists in all the laborious
parts of the kitchen business, [Wages from
8 to 12 guineas a year.]</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN BLOCK-TIN DISH-COVERS, PEWTER POTS, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Mix a little of the finest whiting, free from sand, with the
smallest drop of sweet oil; rub the outside well and wipe it
clean, with clean, dry soft linen rags.—Do the same to the
inside, but wet with water, not oil:—always wiping these
articles dry immediately after using them, and drying them
by the fire, prevents their rusting, and saves much trouble in
cleaning them.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE LADY’S MAID.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> business of the lady’s-maid is extremely
simple, and but little varied. She is generally
to be near the person of her lady; and to be
properly qualified for her situation, her education
should be superior to that of the ordinary
class of females, particularly in needle-work,
and the useful and ornamental branches
of female acquirements. To be peculiarly
neat and clean in her person and dress, is better
than to be tawdry or attractive, as intrinsic
merit is a much greater recommendation
than extrinsic appearance. In her temper she
should be cheerful and submissive, studying
her lady’s disposition, and conforming to it
with alacrity. A soft and courteous demeanour
will best entitle her to esteem and respect.
In fine, her character should be remarkable
for industry and moderation,—her manners
and deportment, for modesty and humility—and
her dress, for neatness, simplicity, and
frugality.</p>

<p>It will be her business to <i>dress</i>, <i>re-dress</i>,
and <i>undress</i> her lady; and, in this, she should
learn to be perfectly <i>au fait</i> and expeditious,
ever studying, so far as it depends on herself,
to manifest good taste, by suiting the ornaments
and decoration of her dress to the
complexion, habits, age, and general appearance
of her person. Thus will she evince her
own good sense, best serve her lady, and
gratify all those who are most interested in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
her welfare and happiness. She should always
be punctual in her attendance, and assiduous
in her attention. Her’s will be the care of her
lady’s <i>wardrobe</i>, and she should make that
her <i>particular</i> care; appropriating to each
article of dress its proper place, where it always
may be found when wanted. It will be
her business carefully to examine every part
of her dress, when taken off, and if they have
sustained an injury, or acquired any spots or
stains, immediately to clean and repair them;<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
then fold them up neatly, and put them away.</p>

<p>Her first business, in the morning, will be
to see that the house-maid has made the fire,
and properly prepared her lady’s dressing-room:—she
then calls her mistress, informs
her of the hour, and having laid out all her
clothes, and carried her <i>hot water</i>, to wash,
she retires to her breakfast with the house-keeper
and other principal servants. When
her lady’s bell rings, she attends her in her
dressing-room,—combs her hair for the morning,
and waits on her till dressed; after which,
she folds and puts away her night-clothes,
cleans her combs and brushes, and adjusts her
toilet-table:—she then retires to her work-room,
to be ready if wanted, and employs
herself in making and altering dresses, millinery,
&amp;c. About one o’clock the family
generally take their lunch, and the servants
their dinner.—After this, she is again summoned
to attend her lady’s toilet whilst dressing
to go abroad. When gone, she again
adjusts her clothes, and every thing in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
room, and lays out and prepares the several
articles that may be required for her dinner,
or evening dress, and afterwards employs herself
at needle-work in her own room, or in her
other avocations, till her mistress returns to
dress for dinner, perhaps about five, when she
attends her for that purpose; and having done
this, it may happen that no further attendance
on her mistress’ person will be required till she
retires to bed: meanwhile she employs herself
at needle-work, as in the morning<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>—or else in
the various occupations of getting up the fine
linen, gauzes, muslins, cambrics, laces, &amp;c.
washing silk stockings, taking the spots or
stains out of silks, &amp;c. &amp;c. for doing which the
best receipts are annexed.</p>

<p>It is her business to see that the house-maid,
or chamber-maid, empties the slops, keeps up
the fires, both in this and the bed-room, (if
wanted) and keeps the rooms in perfect order.—Previous
to her mistress’ retiring for the
night, she will have looked out her night-clothes,
and aired them well; and she will, not
only now, but at all times when she goes to
dress, carry up <i>hot water</i>, for washing, &amp;c. and
when she is gone to bed, she will carefully
examine all her clothes, and do all that is necessary
to be done to them, before she folds
them away. If her lady be elderly, infirm, or
unwell, she will sometimes be required to
bring her work, and sit with her, to administer
her medicines, and sometimes to read to
her. To qualify herself for this latter purpose,
and to acquit herself with propriety, she will,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
at her leisure, practise reading aloud, from the
best authors; as it is important to acquire a
proper style and manner of reading, in all the
varieties of poetry or prose, ode or epistle,
comedy, or sermon; avoiding, alike, the dull
monotony of the school girl, and the formal
affectation of the pedant; but following nature
as her guide, in all that appertains to emphasis,
modulation, and delivery.</p>

<p>If acquainted with the superior branches
of needle-work, she might afford her lady
much gratification, in presenting her, occasionally,
with such trifles as will be acceptable,
and suitable ornaments for her person.—This
will evince her disposition to be grateful and
to oblige; and this, combined with a feminine
sweetness of temper, and suavity of manners,
cannot fail to be her sure recommendation to
the esteem of her superiors and others, through
all the various circumstances of life.—Wages,
from 18 to 25 guineas per annum, with tea and
washing.</p>

<p>As the duties of the lady’s-maid include the
personal ornament, dress, and decoration of
her mistress, we have availed ourselves of a
work recently published, under the title of
“<i>The Art of Beauty</i>,” and in the subsequent
pages have introduced some important receipts
and observations from that work; together
with various approved receipts on other
points of the lady’s-maid’s duty.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">THE WORM PIMPLE WITH BLACK POINTS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">This sort is very common and very annoying to females,
from the age of fourteen and upwards, as they give the skin
a dirty greasy appearance, which no washing will remove.
The vulgar opinion that such pimples are caused by worms
or grubs, is quite erroneous. The best means of removing
the worm pimple, is by squeezing out all the thickened matter
of each; for, unless you do this, it is impossible to get
rid of them, as no wash nor other application will remove
them, nor will they ever disappear of their own accord.
Several things may be useful in preventing their return. Of
these, the Roman balsam, is a safe and excellent application,
and daily rubbing the parts very gently with a soft glove, or
with the warm hand.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">THE SMALL RED PIMPLE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">In this species, the pimples appear singly, and are not
very numerous, and the intermediate skin is unaffected. They
are most liable to appear upon the cheeks, nose, and forehead,
though they sometimes spread over the shoulders and upper
part of the breast. Gowland’s Lotion, Kalydor, Cold
Cream, and all such nostrums, ought to be used with great
caution, but prefer the three following.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">BATEMAN’S SULPHUR WASH.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Break one ounce of sulphur, and pour over it<br>
one quart of boiling water.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Allow it to infuse for twelve or fourteen hours, and apply
it to the face twice or thrice a day, for a few weeks. It is
excellent for removing the roughness of the skin which
usually succeeds pimples.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">KNIGHTON’S LOTION.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Take half a drachm of liquor of potass,<br>
three ounces of spirit of wine.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Apply to the pimples with a camel’s-hair pencil. If this
be too strong, add one half pure water to it.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">DARWIN’S OINTMENT FOR PIMPLES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Take six drachms of mercury,<br>
six grains of flour of sulphur,<br>
two ounces of hog’s lard.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Mix them carefully in a mortar.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">THE LIVID BUTTONY PIMPLE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The pimples, even when they do not suppurate, but especially
while they continue highly red, are always sore and
tender to the touch; so that washing, the friction of the
clothes, &amp;c. are somewhat painful. In its most severe form,
this eruption nearly covers the face, breast, shoulders, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
top of the back, but does not extend lower than an ordinary
tippet in dress.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Mr. Plumbe recommends the pimples to be pricked with
a needle or a lancet, in order to irritate them, and spur them
on to suppuration. When this has been accomplished, the
matter is to be squeezed out, and if any blueness or hardness
remain, sponge the part slightly, three or four times a
day, with the following lotion.</p>

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Dissolve two grains and a half of oxymuriate of mercury in<br>
four ounces of spirit of wine.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Keep it in a close-stopped phial for use.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">BARDOLPH PIMPLE OR ERUPTION.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">A careful examination of the parts, in the earlier stages of
the disease, will, in most cases, lead to the detection of small
and deep-seated collections of matter, which, upon being
let out with a needle, or the point of a lancet, will cause the
swelling and redness of the skin to disappear; and, if the fomentations
of warm water, and frictions with mild soap and
a soft brush be persevered in, along with plain diet, and
abstinence from high-seasoned dishes, pickles, cayenne,
mustard, and strong liquors, a cure may, in time, be effected.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">POMADE FOR REMOVING WRINKLES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take two ounces of the juice of onions, the same quantity
of the white lily, the same of Narbonne honey, and an
ounce of white wax; put the whole into a new earthen
pipkin till the wax is melted; take the pipkin off the fire,
and, in order to mix the whole well together, keep stirring
it with a wooden spatula till it grows quite cold. You will
then have an excellent ointment for removing wrinkles. It
must be applied at night, on going to bed, and not wiped off
till the morning.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">LOTION FOR WRINKLES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take the second water of barley, and strain it through a
piece of fine linen; add a few drops of balm of Mecca;
shake the bottle for a considerable time, till the balm is entirely
incorporated with the water, when it will assume a
somewhat turbid and whitish appearance.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This is an excellent wash for beautifying the face, and
preserving the freshness of youth. If used only once a day,
it takes away wrinkles, and gives surprising brilliancy to the
skin. Before it is applied, the face ought to be washed with
rain-water.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">PERSPIRATION OF THE HANDS AND FEET.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The temporary removal of disagreeable perspiration in
the hands or the feet, may sometimes be useful. The hands
may be dipped in cold water, and if rose-water is at hand, it
will be still better. Washing the hands with the infusion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
or the tincture of galls, or oak bark, into which a little eau
de Cologne, or any other perfume, may be put, is an excellent
application of the same kind in bad cases. With respect
to the feet, dusting them with very fine powder of galls,
or of alum, or, what is, perhaps, still better, soaking the
stockings with any perfumed soap till they are quite saturated,
and then allowing them to dry thoroughly before
putting them on, may be safely and effectually tried.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">COLOURS IN DRESS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Females of fair complexion ought to wear the purest
white; they should choose light and brilliant colours, such
as rose, azure, light yellow, &amp;c. These colours heighten the
lustre of their complexion, which if accompanied with
darker colours, would frequently have the appearance of
alabaster, without life and without expression.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">On the contrary, women of a dark complexion, who dress
in such colours as we too frequently see them do, cause their
skin to appear black, dull, and tanned. They ought, therefore,
to avoid wearing linen or laces of too brilliant a white;
they ought to avoid white robes, and rose-colour, or light-blue
ribbons, which form too disagreeable a contrast with
their complexions.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Fair women cannot be too careful to correct, by light colours,
the paleness of their complexions; and dark women,
by stronger colours, the somewhat yellow tint of their complexion.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Crimson is extremely handsome at night, when it may be
substituted for rose-colour, which loses its charms by candle-light;
but this crimson, seen by day, spoils the most beautiful
complexion; no colour whatever strips it so completely
of all its attractions. Pale yellow, on the contrary, is
often very handsome by day, and is perfectly suited to people
who have a fine complexion; but at night it appears dirty,
and tarnishes the lustre of the complexion, to which it is
designed to add brilliancy.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Green is the only colour which should be worn as a summer
veil.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">USE OF PAINTS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The vegetable substances which furnish rouge, are red
sandal-wood, root of orchanet, cochineal, Brazil wood, and
especially the bastard saffron, which yields a very beautiful
colour, when it is mixed with a sufficient quantity of talc.
Some perfumers compose vegetable rouge, for which they
take vinegar as the excipient. These reds are liable to injure
the beauty of the skin; it is more advisable to mix
them with oily or unctuous matter, and to form salves. For
this purpose, you may employ balm of Mecca, butter of
cacao, spermaceti, oil of bhen, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span></p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The red powders, above described, are best put on by a
fine camel-hair pencil. The colours in the dishes, wools,
and green papers, are commonly laid on by the tip of the
little finger, previously wetted.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The Spanish wool, the papers, and the English-made Portuguese
dishes, are all made from a moss-like drug, from
Turkey, called safflower, well known to scarlet dyers, &amp;c.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">WHITE PAINTS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">White paints are extracted from minerals, more or less
pernicious, but always corrosive. They affect the eyes,
which swell and inflame, and are rendered painful and watery.
They change the texture of the skin, on which they
produce pimples, and cause rheums; attack the teeth, make
them ache, destroy the enamel, and loosen them.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO MAKE TALC WHITE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take a piece of the talc white, known by the name of Briançon
chalk; choose it of a pearl grey colour, and rasp it
gently with a piece of dog’s skin; after this, sift it through
a sieve of very fine silk, and put this powder into a pint
of good distilled vinegar, in which leave it for a fortnight,
taking care to shake the bottle or pot several times each
day, except the last, on which it must not be disturbed;
pour off the vinegar, so as to leave the chalk behind in the
bottle, into which pour very clean water that has been filtered;
throw the whole into a clean pan, and stir the water well
with a wooden spatula; let the powder settle again to the
bottom; pour the water gently off, and wash the powder six
or seven times, taking care always to make use of filtered
water. When the powder is as soft and as white as you
would wish, dry it in a place where it is not exposed to the
dust; sift it through a silken sieve, which will make it still
finer. It may be either left in powder, or wetted and formed
into cakes, like those sold by the perfumers. One pint of vinegar
is sufficient to dissolve a pound of talc.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This white may be used in the same manner as carmine,
dipping your finger, or a piece of paper, or what is preferable
to either, a hare’s foot, prepared for the purpose in
ointment, and putting upon it about a grain of this white,
which will not be removed, even by perspiration. If the
ointment with which it is applied is properly made, this
white does no injury to the face. The same ingredients may
be used for making rouge.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">COSMETIC JUICE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Make a hole in a lemon, fill it up with sugar candy, and
close it nicely with gold leaf, applied over the rind that was
cut out; then roast the lemon in hot ashes. When desirous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
of using the juice, squeeze out a little through the hole already
made, and wash the face with a napkin wetted therewith.
This juice is said to cleanse the skin, and brighten
the complexion marvellously.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">BALSAM FOR CHAPPED LIPS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Take two tea-spoonsful of clarified honey,<br>
and a few drops of lavender-water, or any other<br>
agreeable perfume.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Mix, and anoint the parts frequently. If the hands are
affected, anoint them all over on going to bed, wearing your
gloves all night, and wash with tepid milk and water in the
morning. A night or two will effect a cure.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">EXCELLENT TOOTH-BRUSH.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Procure two or three dozen of the fresh roots of marsh-mallows,
and dry them carefully in the shade, so that they
may not shrivel. They must be chosen about as thick as a
cane, and cut to five or six inches long, then with a mallet
bruise the ends of them very gently, for about half an inch
down, in order to form a brush. Then take two ounces of
dragon’s blood, four ounces of highly rectified spirit, and
half an ounce of fresh conserve of roses, and put them in a
glazed pipkin or pan, to dissolve over a gentle fire. When
dissolved, put in your prepared mallow-roots, stirring them
to make them take the dye equally. Continue this till no
moisture remains in the vessel, when the roots will be hard,
dry, and fit for use. If you take care of them, they will
last you a considerable time. When you use this toothbrush,
it may be dipped in the following:</p>

dry them on nets, about the same fineness as cabbage-nets.
Shake them from time to time, on the nets; as they dry,
they will fall through the mashes, when collect them for

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE HEAD NURSE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the hopes of families, and the comfort
and happiness of parents are confided to the
charge of females who superintend nurseries
of children, no duties are more important, and
none require more incessant and unremitting
care and anxiety. Every symptom of approaching
disease should be watched and reported
to the parents or medical attendant of
the family, and in this respect, nothing should
be concealed or deferred till remedies are too
late. In the daily washings, the state of the
skin should be examined and noticed, as well
as the tongue and the appetite, and spirits; and
above all things, all chances of accident or
juvenile mischief should be guarded against
and removed. Windows should be fenced
with bars, or the lower sashes nailed down;
knives and sharp instruments should be kept
out of reach; scalding water and dangerous
ingredients secured from access; ponds and
rivers fenced in; ladders removed; and fire-places
guarded by well-fastened wire fenders.</p>

<p>This important Servant ought to be of a
lively and cheerful disposition, perfectly good
tempered, and clean and neat in her habits
and person. She ought also to have been accustomed
to the care and management of
young children, as all the junior branches of
the family are intrusted to her care and superintendence,
confiding in her skill, experience,
and attention. She usually takes the sole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
charge of the infant from its birth, when the
parent suckles it: to assist her in the management
of this and the other children in the
nursery, she has under nurses assigned her,
who are entirely under her controul.</p>

<p>The youngest nurse, or nursery-maid,
usually rises about 6 o’clock to light the fire,
and do the household work of the nursery before
the children are up, perhaps about seven
o’clock, at which time the head nurse is dressed,
and ready to bathe and wash them all
over with a sponge and warm water; after
which they are rubbed quite dry and dressed.
This process, when there are several children,
usually occupies the nurses an hour, or an
hour and a half, when their breakfast is got
ready, and the children are placed at their
meal in the most peaceable and orderly manner.
After breakfast, if the weather be favourable,
the children are taken out by the
assistant nurse, or nursery maid, for air and
exercise, an hour or perhaps two, but not so
long as to fatigue either of them. On their return,
their hands and feet are washed, if damp
or dirty, after which they attend to their lessons
till dinner time. After dinner, if it be fine
weather, the children are again taken abroad
for air and exercise, and on their return again,
after having their hands and feet washed, if
necessary, they are in due time, about eight
o’clock, dressed and put to bed. The Head
Nurse finds ample employment during the
whole day, in paying due attention to her infant
charge, in giving directions, and in seeing
that the whole business of the nursery is properly
executed.</p>

<p>The sleeping room of the Nursery should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
spacious, lofty, dry, airy, and not suffered to be
inhabited in the day time. No servants should
sleep in the same room, nor ought any thing
to be done there that may contaminate the
air, in which so great a portion of infantine
life is to be spent. The consequences of vitiated
air in bed-rooms are often fatal. Feather-beds
and bed-curtains ought to be proscribed,
as tending to debility; neither ought the beds
to be placed too low, as the most pernicious
stratum of air is that nearest the floor.</p>

<p>The air of the sleeping room ought to be
changed immediately on the children’s leaving
the room, by opening the windows and doors;
the beds ought, also, to be shaken up and left
to cool; the slops cleared away; and every
thing made and kept perfectly clean. In damp
or bad weather, a fire must be made in the
room to purify the air.</p>

<p>The management of infant children, has a
more important influence on the health and
happiness of man, than is generally imagined;
as, at this period of existence, the foundation
is laid either for irremediable debility, or for
<i>mental</i> and <i>bodily</i> vigour. An Infant, consequently
requires considerable care, and indefatigable
personal attention.</p>

<p>Its management for the first two months,
cannot be too gentle, kind, or tender. Nothing
should be done at first that can give it
uneasiness; therefore, next to its health and
well-being, regard should be had to its disposition,
and the regulation of its temper; with
this view also, the most rational way is to let
the infant enjoy all the liberty it possibly can,
without being restrained by its clothing, or
starved by system. To set a child upright<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>
before the end of the first month is hurtful:
afterwards the nurse may begin to set it up
and dance it by degrees. It must be kept as
dry as possible.</p>

<p>The clothing should be very light, and not
too long, so that the legs may be got at with
ease, in order to have them often rubbed in
the day, with a warm hand, or flannel, and
particularly the inside of them. Rubbing
the child all over takes off scurf, and promotes
the circulation of the blood.</p>

<p>A nurse ought to keep a child as little in
her arms as possible, lest the legs should be
cramped, and the toes turned inwards. Let
her always keep the child’s legs loose. The
oftener the posture is changed, the better.</p>

<p>For the first fortnight or three weeks it
should be always laid on a bed, except when
taken up to supply its wants, which will give
it habits of cleanliness at a very early age.</p>

<p>It may be very comfortably laid on a cushion,
where it can be in no danger of falling, nor of
any thing falling on it. Some one should sit
by it, and divert and cheer it, if necessary,
and take it up instantly, when it expresses
the least dissatisfaction. A nurse should
make it a strict rule, that the child should be
in her own view, in whatever she may be employed.</p>

<p>By slow degrees, the infant may be accustomed
to exercise, both within doors and
in the open air: but it never should be moved
about immediately after sucking or feeding,
as that will be apt to sicken it. Exercise
should be given it by carrying it about, and
gently dandling it in the arms; tossing an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
infant about, and exercising it in the open air,
in fine weather, is of the greatest service to it,
in preventing distortion. In cities, children
ought not to be kept in hot rooms, but to have
as much air as possible; want of exercise being
the cause of rickets, large heads, weak joints,
a contracted breast, and diseased lungs, besides
a numerous train of evils.</p>

<p>Endeavour to harden the body, but without
resorting to violent means. A child is
constitutionally weak and irritable to a high
degree; hence we should endeavour to
diminish this irritability, in order to procure
it the greatest happiness of life, a firm body,
whence may result a sound mind.</p>

<p>Such management is highly advantageous,
as it will enable children to support every
species of fatigue and hardship, when they
become adults.</p>

<p>The plan of hardening children may, however,
be carried to excess. An extravagant
attempt to strengthen youth, deprives them
of all their natural susceptibility of excitement,
renders them insensible, and produces
many bad effects, while they only acquire
temporary energy, which decreases as they
advance in years, and is attended with an
early loss of their primitive vigour.</p>

<p>All attempts to render children hardy must,
therefore, be made by gradual advances: for
nature admits of no sudden transition. When
children have once been accustomed to a
hardy system of education, such a plan must
be strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>The child’s skin is to be kept perfectly
clean by washing its limbs morning and evening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
and likewise its neck and ears; beginning
with warm water, till, by degrees, it will not
only bear, but like to be washed with cold.</p>

<p>After it is a month old, if it has no cough,
fever, nor eruption, the bath should be colder
and colder (if the season be mild) and by degrees
it may be used as it comes from the
spring. After carefully drying the whole
body, head, and limbs, a second dry soft
cloth, somewhat warmed, should be gently
used, to take all the damp from the wrinkles
or soft parts of the body. Then rub the
limbs; but when the body is rubbed, take
special care not to press upon the stomach or
belly. On these parts, the hand should move
in a circle, because the bowels lie in that direction.
If the skin be chafed, hair-powder
is to be used. The utmost tenderness is necessary
in drying the head; and a small, soft,
brush, lightly applied, is safer than a comb.</p>

<p>Clean cloths, every morning and evening,
will tend greatly to a child’s health and comfort.</p>

<p>The dress of the child by day should be
light and loose, and for the night, it may be a
shirt, a blanket to tie on, and a thin gown to
tie over the blanket.</p>

<p>The unnecessary haste in which some
nurses are accustomed to dress children, cannot
be too strongly reprehended. In addition to
this hurried dressing, its clothes are often injuriously
tight. Pins should never be used in
an infant’s clothes; and every string should
be so loosely tied, that two fingers may be introduced
under it. Bandages round the head
should be strictly forbidden, for to this error<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>
many instances of idiotism, fits, and deformity,
may be traced.</p>

<p>Never allow the infant to be held opposite
to open doors and windows. The air is beneficial,
when it is in motion, and the weather
is moderate, but it should always have
some covering besides that which it wears in
the house, when taken out; and it must not
be laid on the cold ground, nor allowed to
step on it, when it begins to use its feet. The
intense heat of a summer day should likewise
be avoided; excessive heat or cold being
equally injurious.</p>

<p>The wisest maxim in treating infants with
respect to food and drink, is to follow the
simple dictates of nature; yet some nurses
give them wine, spirits, spices, sugar, &amp;c.
which the stomach of a grown person would
reject. At all times the utmost care will
be necessary to avoid hurting its gums when
feeding it. Its food should be gradually
cooled in a saucer, and it should be given to
it in a small spoon, only half filled, which
will save its clothes from being soiled, and
keep its bosom dry. Let it swallow one small
portion, before another is offered, and raise
its head, that it may pass the gullet easily.
Never entice or press it to take more, if it
once refuses, for it knows best when it has
had enough.</p>

<p>As long as it has its mother’s milk, no
other sustenance will be wanting, if she be a
good nurse. If there should be the least
doubt of her having milk enough, the child
may have cow’s milk, mixed with two-thirds
soft boiled water, presented to its lips very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
frequently; but it never should be urged to
accept it.</p>

<p>Rising early in the morning is good for all
children, provided they awake of themselves,
which they generally do; but they ought never
to be waked out of their sleep. As soon as
possible, however, they should be brought to
regular sleep in the day.</p>

<p>Children, till they are two or three years’
old, must never be suffered to walk so long at
a time as to be weary.</p>

<p>In laying a child to sleep, it should be
placed on the right side oftener than on the
left. Laying it on its back when it is awake, is
enough of that posture, in which alone it can
move its legs and arms with freedom.</p>

<p>Infants cannot sleep too long; and it is a
favourable symptom when they enjoy calm and
continued rest, of which they should by no
means be deprived, as this is the greatest support
granted to them by nature. Sleep promotes
a more calm and uniform circulation of
the blood, and it facilitates assimilation of the
nutriment received. The horizontal posture,
likewise, is the most favourable to the growth
and bodily developement of the infant.</p>

<p>Sleep ought to be in proportion to the age
of the infant, and this salutary refreshment
should fill up the greater part of a child’s existence.
After the age of six months, the
periods of sleep, as well as all other animal
functions, may, in some degree, be regulated;
yet, even then, a child should be suffered to
sleep the whole night, and several hours both
in the morning and afternoon. Nurses should
endeavour to accustom infants, from the time
of their birth, to sleep in the night in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
preference to the day, and for this purpose they
will remove all external impressions which
may disturb their rest, but especially they
ought to avoid obeying every call for taking
them up, and giving food at improper times.</p>

<p>To awaken children from their sleep with a
noise, or in an impetuous manner, is certainly
injudicious and hurtful; nor is it proper to
carry them from a dark room immediately into
a glaring light, against a dazzling wall; for
the sudden impression of light debilitates the
organs of vision, and causes weak eyes from
early infancy.</p>

<p>Infants are sometimes very restless at night,
which is generally owing either to their eating
a heavy supper, to their tight night-clothes, or
their being over-heated by too many blankets.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">THE YELLOW GUM.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The yellow gum is known by a yellow tinge of the skin,
with languor and a tendency to sleep. It is to be relieved
by giving a tea-spoonful or more of castor oil, to clear the
intestines. When the disease does not give way to this
treatment, three drops of antimonial wine are to be given
in a tea-spoonful of water, so as to prove emetic. In about
eight or ten hours, this is to be followed by ½ a grain of calomel,
or four grains of rhubarb.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">VOMITING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">When the food is vomited in an unaltered state, it is generally
a sign of over feeding: but when the vomiting is
bilious, or when the food is partly digested, the diet ought
to be changed, and the bowels opened by one grain of calomel,
given in sugar. This is to be followed by a tea-spoonful
of castor oil on the following morning. If the vomiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
should still continue, give a gentle emetic, and the calomel
powder (containing one or two grains, according to the age)</p>

<p>soon afterwards. If there be much irritation, apply a blister to
the stomach; and, if possible, give a tea-spoonful of the
saline medicine, in a state of effervescence, and containing
two drops of laudanum.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">HICCUPS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">These generally arise from acidity in the stomach, and
may be remedied by the administration of eight grains of
prepared chalk, with two grains of powdered rhubarb, given
in a little syrup, or gruel. If very severe, the stomach is
to be rubbed with soap liniment, or opodeldoc, to which a
little laudanum has been added.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">GRIPING AND FLATULENCY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">These are known by continual crying, restlessness, and
drawing up of the legs. When attended by diarrhœa and
green stools, they are to be relieved, in general, by the administration
of a few grains of rhubarb and magnesia. If
sour belchings, &amp;c. still continue, a tea-spoonful of very weak
solution of tartar emetic should be given every quarter of
an hour, until the child vomits. After this, particularly if
there be any purging, it may be proper to give a little
rhubarb and magnesia again, and now and then a little chalk
mixture.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Absorbent Mixture.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">If the pains are very great, so as to make the child scream
violently, two tea-spoonfuls of the following mixture, with
five or six drops of laudanum, may be given directly:—</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Mix together, prepared chalk, 1 scruple,
tincture of caraway seeds, 3 drams,
compound spirit of lavender, 1 do.
and of peppermint water, 2&#160;oz.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">As soon as there is diminution of pain, a purgative should
be given, particularly if the bowels happen to be in a costive
state. The best will be castor oil. The above mixture
may afterwards be occasionally continued, but without the
laudanum.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Anodyne Plaster.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The late Dr. Clarke, of Burlington Street, frequently
ordered the following plaster to be applied over the bowels
of infants, in case of griping and inflammatory excitement
of the intestines:—</p>

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Take of compound plaster of laudanum, 1½&#160;oz.<br>
diachylon plaster, 2 drams,<br>

</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">DIARRHŒA.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">This may, in general, if the stools are green, be relieved
by a brisk purgative, of from one to two grains of calomel,
with four or five of rhubarb, according to the age of the
child.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">EXCORIATIONS OF THE SKIN.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Children are apt to be chafed between the thighs, behind
the ears, and in the wrinkles of the neck, for want of proper
attention to cleanliness. In such cases it will be necessary
to bathe the parts twice a day, (or every time that the
child’s clothes are changed,) with a little water gruel,
and to apply a puff with a little hair powder immediately
afterwards, so as to keep the parts dry.—When <i>discharges</i>
take place behind the ears, they must not be dried up too
suddenly, as such a circumstance might produce a divertion
to the brain. In this case it will always be best to give
frequent doses of castor oil, or calomel, every night, in the
proportion of one grain to three grains of rhubarb.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">CUTANEOUS ERUPTIONS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">No real danger attends these eruptions, which are generally
known by the names of red-gum, nettle-rash, &amp;c. All
that is required to be done, is to keep the bowels open by
such means as are prescribed in the foregoing articles; and
to guard against cold, which might drive the eruption inwardly,
and thus produce internal inflammations of a critical
nature. If the milk or food be considered the cause, the
nurse, or diet, ought to be changed: and if sickness and
vomiting should prevail, it will be proper to give the <i>absorbent
mixture</i> mentioned under the head <span class="smcap">griping and flatulency</span>.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">THE THRUSH.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">This disease makes its appearance by little ulcerations in
the mouth, tongue, &amp;c. of a white colour, and sometimes of
a yellow appearance. They are generally owing to acidities
in the stomach, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In this disorder nothing avails more than an emetic at
first, and then a little magnesia and rhubarb, (if there is
diarrhœa,) with thin chicken-water as drink. Testaceous
powders, or the <i>absorbent mixture</i> (<i>see</i> <span class="smcap">griping and flatulency</span>,)
will also be proper. If there is no looseness, it
will be proper to give a grain or two of calomel, with three
or four grains of rhubarb. The mouth and throat should
at the same time be cleansed by gargles.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Syrup of Black Currants.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Take of the juice of black currants, strained, 1 pint,<br>
double refined sugar, 24&#160;oz.<br>
Dissolve the sugar, and boil to make a syrup.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">A tea-spoonful of this to be given to children in the
thrush.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">FALLING DOWN OF THE FUNDAMENT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">This happens frequently to children who cry much, or
who have had a diarrhœa, or from straining on going to stool.
If it proceed from costiveness, give lenitive clysters. In
case the gut be swelled or inflamed, foment with warm
milk, or decoction of oak bark, or wash frequently with
cold water. The protruded parts are now to be replaced by
the finger, and supported by a truss or bandage. The internal
use of tonics will be proper.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">DENTITION.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">When children are about cutting their teeth, they slaver
much, are feverish, hot, and uneasy; their gums swell, and
are very painful; they are sometimes loose in the bowels,
and at other times costive; and occasionally convulsions
come on.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Leeches are often serviceable when applied behind the
ears; as are also blisters.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Scarifying the Gums.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Instead of giving narcotics to children cutting their teeth,
it is strenuously recommended to have their tumid gums
divided by a lancet down to the tooth; an operation at once
safe and unattended with pain. If done in time, by removing
the cause of the complaint, all the symptoms will disappear
of themselves. Instead of giving preparations of
opium, it will be found, in the majority of cases, far better
to administer calomel, in minute doses, as this medicine is
well known to possess peculiar efficacy in promoting absorption
in these parts. The body, if costive, should be kept
regularly open, and if there should be looseness of the bowels,
it should by no means be discouraged. Instead of coral,
or any other hard body, let the child nibble at a piece of
wax candle.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">CONVULSIONS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Children are particularly liable to convulsions at the
period of teething, small pox, measles, and other eruptive
diseases; sometimes, also, from external causes, such as
strait clothes, bandages, &amp;c. When they proceed from any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>
of these, bathing the feet, or the whole body, in warm water,
of 92 or 94 degrees, and administering a mild clyster,
will almost immediately relieve them. To shorten the duration
of the fit, cold water should be poured over the face
and neck, whilst the rest of the body is in the bath.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The return of convulsions is to be prevented only by the
removal of the cause of the existing irritation; but, in
general, when the body is kept carefully open, there will
be little reason to fear a return.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">INWARD FITS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">In these fits the infant appears as if asleep, the eyelids
however are not quite closed, but frequently twinkle and
shew the whites turned upwards. The muscles of the face
are sometimes slightly distorted, the mouth having the appearance
of a laugh or smile. The breath is sometimes
very quick, and at others stops for a time; whilst the eyelids
and lips are alternately pale and dark. The infant
startles on the least noise, and sighs deeply, or breaks wind.
This relieves him for a little, but he soon relapses into a
doze. Whenever the above-mentioned symptoms are observed,
it will be right to awaken the infant, by stirring or
otherwise, and to rub its back and belly well before the fire,
until wind escapes. At the same time it will be proper to
give half a tea-spoonful of drink or pap, containing two
drops of oil of anise or caraways. As soon after as possible,
a purgative of castor oil, or a grain or two of calomel
(according to the age,) with two or three grains of rhubarb,
is to be given, to empty the bowels of whatever crude matter
may occasion the disorder.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">THE RICKETS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">This disorder affects the bones of children, and causes a
considerable protuberance, incurvation, or distortion of
them. It may arise from various causes, but more particularly
when proper care has not been taken with children:
when they have been too tightly swathed in some parts, and
too loose in others; keeping them too long in one and the
same position; and not keeping them clean and dry. Sometimes
it may proceed from a lax habit, and at others from
costiveness.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">It usually appears about the eighth or ninth month, and
continues till the sixth or seventh year of the child’s age.
The head becomes large, and the fontanelle keeps long open;
the countenance is full and florid; the joints knotty and distorted,
especially about the wrists; less near the ancles.
The ribs protuberate, and grow crooked; the belly swells;
a cough and disorder of the lungs succeed; and the child
moves but weakly, and waddles in walking.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Regimen, &amp;c.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The regimen should be light and properly seasoned; the
air dry and clear. Exercise and motion should be encouraged,
and bandages, as well as instruments, contrived
to keep the limbs in a proper situation; but care should be
taken that they be so formed as not to put the child to pain,
or restrain it too much.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Cold sea-bathing is of infinite use; after which friction
should be used, and the child placed between two blankets,
so as to encourage perspiration. The back should be well
rubbed with opodeldoc, or good old rum, every night.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">A few grains of ipecacuanha or calomel may occasionally
be proper, and chalybeates are also very serviceable.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">A decoction of Peruvian bark is also good with red wine:
and should be used with moderation in the forenoon and
after dinner.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">DISTORTION OF THE SPINE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Examine the child’s back-bone frequently and closely,
and on the slightest trace of any distortion wash the same
with brandy every morning and night, and pay the strictest
attention to the child’s keeping a straight posture; both
sleeping and waking; and if it can be bathed from time to
time, it will be advisable.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">RING WORM AND SCALD HEADS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">It is well known that these disorders, which are in many
respects similar, are contagious; therefore, no comb or
hair-brush used by a child affected by them is to be used by
another child, either in a school or in the same family. Nor
should the hat or cap of such a child be worn by any other.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Treatment.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Let the hair be removed carefully with a razor, dipped
frequently in olive oil; and afterwards apply the following

going to rest, and repeated every night; also the use of salt
water externally and internally, as an alterative, has been
found very useful.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In all cases the bowels ought to be kept open, and the
diet should consist of wholesome and nutritive food; avoiding
fish and salt meats. Cleanliness, and an occasional use

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Regimen, &amp;c.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">A frequent change of air is exceedingly useful in hooping
cough, particularly short voyages at sea; at the same time
flannel is to be worn next the skin. Young children should
lie with their heads and shoulders raised; and when the
cough occurs, they ought to be placed on their feet and
bent a little forward, to guard against suffocation. The diet
should be light, and the drink warm and mucilaginous.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">THE CROUP.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The <span class="smcap">croup</span> is a disease peculiar to children, and generally
fatal, if care is not taken in the commencement. It
commonly approaches with the usual signs of a catarrh, but
sometimes the peculiar symptoms occur at the first onset;
namely, a hoarseness, with a shrill ringing sound both in
speaking and coughing, as if the noise came from a brazen
tube. At the same time there is a sense of pain about the
larynx, and some difficulty of respiration, with a whizzing
sound in inspiration, as if the passage of air was diminished;
which is actually the case. The cough is generally dry, but
if any thing is spit up, it is a purulent matter, sometimes
resembling small portions of a membrane. There are also a
frequent pulse, restlessness, and an uneasy sense of heat.
The inside of the mouth is sometimes without inflammation,
but frequently a redness, and even a swelling exist. Sometimes
there is an appearance of matter on them like that
rejected by coughing.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Remedies.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">As soon as possible a brisk emetic should be administered
for the purpose of freeing the patient from the coagulable
lymph which is already secreted. Topical bleeding, by
means of leeches, should immediately succeed, and the discharge
be encouraged. As soon as it diminishes, a blister, sufficiently
large to cover the whole throat, should be applied, and
suffered to lie on for thirty hours or longer. The steam of
warm water should be inhaled, and the bowels should be
evacuated by calomel.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">As soon as the emetic has operated sufficiently, opium
may be administered, by which means the breathing will in
general be soon relieved; but should it become more difficult
in the course of a few hours, the emetic is to be again
repeated, and after its operation the opium again employed.
This practice is to be alternately used till the patient is out
of danger, which will, in general, be in the course of three
or four days. The child should be kept nearly upright in bed.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Children, until the age of six years, are liable to be attacked
by <span class="smcap">bilious fever</span>, which is gradually developed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>
by irregularity in the bowels, which are either too costive,
or too much relaxed.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">On its first appearance, the child becomes peevish and
fretful, his lips are dry, his hands hot, accompanied by
shortness of breath, pains in the head, and quickness of
pulse, which beats from 110 to 112 in a minute; he shows
an unwillingness to stir or speak, starts in his sleep, and has
a loathing for food. The stools have often a mucous and
slimy appearance; some children are affected with delirium,
others dull and stupid, and many are for a time speechless.
Several slight accessions of fever take place in the course
of the day, during which the child is usually drowsy; in the
intervals of these paroxysms he appears tolerably well,
though, at times, unusually peevish.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">These symptoms are more or less prevalent for eight or
ten days, when suddenly a more violent paroxysm of fever
will ensue, preceded by a shivering fit, and sometimes an
incessant vomiting of bile. The pulse rises to 140; the
cheeks are flushed, the child’s drowsiness increases, and
when awake, he resorts to picking at the skin of the nose,
lips, and eyes, to a most painful degree.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This species of fever is mild at the commencement, slow
in its progress, and very uncertain in its event. The desire
for food is destroyed, and the child will take neither aliment
nor medicine. The stools are changed from their natural
appearances, being sometimes black, and smelling like
putrid mud; and at other times they are curdled, with
shreds of coagulable lymph floating in a dark green fluid.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Treatment.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The first thing, is to cleanse the stomach by a few
grains of ipecacuanha, and soon afterwards to administer
some active purgative. For restoring the healthy secretions
of the bowels, nothing is so efficacious as small and
often repeated doses of calomel and scammony, (¾ of a
grain of the former to 1¼ of the latter,) followed up after
some hours by a solution of Epsom salts in an infusion of
senna, or by a dose of castor oil. When the stomach is very
irritable, small quantities of chalk mixture, with a few drops
of laudanum, are to be given alternately with the above-mentioned
purgatives.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">If the head is much affected, leeches should be applied
to the temples, and if the stomach will not retain the medicine,
from three to six leeches should be applied to the upper
part of the belly, or right side; and after this a blister,
if necessary. The warm bath will prove useful after the
stomach and bowels are properly cleansed.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Tonic Powder.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">To obviate debility, when the fever has abated, the following
tonic powder is recommended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span></p>

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Mix together 2 drams of powder of cascarilla,<br>
24 grains of rhubarb, and<br>
1 scruple sub-carbonate of iron.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Divide this into 24 papers, one to be taken morning and
evening.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Regimen and Diet.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The child should likewise be sent into the country as soon
as possible, and be allowed every reasonable amusement, to
dissipate the peevishness which is an invariable consequence
of a severe attack of this disease. The diet, for a time,
should be light and nourishing; as jellies, isinglass and milk,
veal broth, and beef tea. The drink may be whey, and
toast and water.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE GOVERNESS, or GOUVERNANTE.</p>


<p>As many mothers have an aversion to public
education for their daughters, the system of
<span class="smcap">private instruction</span>, by a respectable and
well-educated female, is very generally adopted,
in many families of moderate fortune,
and in all of rank and opulence. Hence there
is a constant demand for females of genteel
manners, and finished education, at salaries
which vary according to qualifications, and
number and age of pupils, between 25<i>l.</i> and
120<i>l.</i> per annum, and often improved, on certain
great length of service, by some provision
for life.</p>

<p>Teachers in seminaries, half-boarders, educated
for the purpose, and the unsettled
daughters of respectable families of moderate
fortune, who have received a finished education,
are usually selected for this important
duty; and the engagement is made either
through an advertisement in the newspapers,
or by agents who arrange between the parties
for a moderate fee. But, in general, families
apply to the governesses of public seminaries,
who have young women in training for these
employments.</p>

<p>The qualifications, of course, are various,
and may vary with the age of the pupils.
Good temper, and good manners, with a genteel
exterior, are indispensable: for more is
learnt by example than precept. Besides, the
governess who desires to be on a footing with
the family, ought to be able to conduct herself
in such manner, as never to render an apology
necessary for her presence at family parties.</p>

<p>In addition to a thorough knowledge of the
<span class="smcap">English language</span>, and to the power of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span>
able to write a letter in a graceful and accurate
style, the governess ought to be moderately
acquainted with the <span class="smcap">French language</span>; and
it would be an advantage if she knew something
of <span class="smcap">Italian</span>, as the language of music.
She ought also to be able to play on the <span class="smcap">piano
forte</span>, so as to give the first lessons, and to
superintend the practice directed in the lessons
of a master; and in cases where great perfection
is not desired, to render a master
unnecessary. If she can perform on the harp
or guitar, these instruments will qualify her
to accommodate her instructions to various
tastes. It will be also expected that she shall
be able to teach the elements of <span class="smcap">dancing</span>, at
least, the steps and ordinary figures of fashionable
practice. Nor ought she to be ignorant
of the useful art of <span class="smcap">arithmetic</span>, the constant
exercise of which, will so much improve the
reasoning powers of her pupils. <span class="smcap">Needle-work</span>
of various descriptions, from the plain
to the ornamental, will, as matter of course,
be expected; and there can be no reason why
she should omit to introduce to her pupils the
geographical copy books, and other elementary
books of <span class="smcap">geography</span>, by Goldsmith; and
the familiar keys to the <span class="smcap">popular sciences</span>,
published by Blair and Barrow, such as the
Universal Preceptor, the Class Book, the
Grammar of Natural Philosophy, the Key to
General Knowledge, by Barrow, and other
superior works of the same kind, the selection
of which, will distinguish her good sense:
while the answering the questions, and filling
up the copy books on the admirable Interrogative
System, will be the means of incalculable
advantage to her pupils, and a source of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
infinite gratification to their parents. The
branches of <span class="smcap">elegant literature</span> are also
within her reach, in such books as Aikin’s
Poetry for Children, and Pratt’s Selection of
Classical Poetry; and if she chooses to expand
their intelligence, she can provide them
with Blair’s Belles Lettres, Shaw’s Nature
Displayed, (a book which ought to be found
in every family,) and with a pair of globes, a
microscope, and a telescope. <span class="smcap">Drawing</span> is
also so essential an accomplishment, that its
constant exercise should be kept up by means
of Hamilton’s Elementary Examples, or those
of Chalons and Calvert.</p>

<p>No young persons who are born to the enjoyment
of fortune, and destined to fill any stations
in society with credit and advantage,
ought to have these accomplishments and
sources of knowledge withheld from them;
and the governess who contents herself with
mere personal attainments, without at the
same time addressing instruction to the <span class="smcap">mind</span>
of her pupils, and who lays before them old-fashioned
books, and obsolete systems of
knowledge, compromises her own character,
and sacrifices through their lives, the interests,
welfare, and reputation, of her pupils.</p>

<p>In the sub-division of time, prolonged application
is wearisome, and too frequent renewals
are irksome. The best time for learning
is in the morning before breakfast, and
one hour and a half, or two hours, between
seven and nine, will always be worth the three
hours, which should be industriously passed,
between eleven and two. The rest of the day
should be devoted, in fine weather, to <span class="smcap">exercise</span>
and <span class="smcap">amusements</span> in the open air; and in
bad weather to such amusements as induce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>
exercise, of which, dancing, the skipping-rope,
and dumb-bells, should form a part, and certain
games which are practised in genteel
society, as chess and cards, may be advantageously
introduced in winter evenings.</p>

<p>Religion, morals, and temper, should be
specially studied, and the essays of Mrs. Chapone,
and Mrs. Hannah More, Barrow’s
Questions, his School Bible, and School Sermons,
with Blair’s or Enfield’s Sermons, are
suitable auxiliaries. Bad habits should be
watched and corrected, and graceful ones,
cleanliness and neatness of person, be stimulated.
Blair’s Governess’s Register of Study and
Conduct, will prove an excellent auxiliary. Superstitions,
and vulgar faith in dreams, signs,
omens, fortune-telling, and other weaknesses
of mind, should be constantly exposed.</p>

<p>A governess, influenced by these practices
and principles, will entitle herself to live on a
footing with a family, when there are no special
parties; and she must possess good sense
enough not to intrude on that domestic privacy,
and personal independence, which, without
offence, is often desirable. Her own
apartment, or that of her pupils, ought to be
at once the scene of her pleasure and amusement,
and if she mingles with the parties of
the families, she must, of course, not make
herself too familiar with the domestic servants.</p>

<p>Thus conducting herself with propriety, and
identifying herself with the growing minds
and affections of her pupils, she may secure
their personal friendship to the end of their
mutual lives, and if their moral feelings are
not blunted, she may calculate on their gratitude
in her old age, or if she survive them,
in their last will.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE UPPER HOUSE MAID.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> large families, where there is much work,
two or more house maids are kept, but as the
Upper House Maid has generally the superintendence
and responsibility of all, we shall
include their principal labours under one
general head.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Upper House Maid</span> should be fully
competent to undertake the management of
all the household business of a gentleman’s
family; and to be perfectly qualified for her
situation, she ought to have been previously
initiated in the capacity of <i>Under House
Maid</i>.</p>

<p>In most families she has the care of all the
household linen, bed and table linen, napkins,
towels, &amp;c. which she also makes and keeps
in repair, and besides cleaning the house and
furniture, and making the beds, she washes
her own clothes, and has sometimes to assist
the laundry-maid in getting up the fine linen,
washing silk stockings, &amp;c. instead of the
lady’s maid; but these latter are considered as
rather <i>extra</i> labours, and are not, in all families,
deemed a necessary part of the house maid’s
business. She also cleans all the coal skuttles
in use above stairs, and all the kettles used for
warming water in the dressing-rooms, &amp;c.
When there are dinner parties the house-maid
washes up the plate and china.</p>

<p>The house-maid, in a regular family, will
find it necessary to rise about five o’clock, and
her first business will be to open the shutters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span>
of the usual family sitting-rooms; as the
breakfast-room and library, whence she clears
away all the superfluous articles that may have
been left there, and prepares for cleaning the
stoves, fire-places, and hearths, by rolling up
the hearth rugs, carefully carrying them out to
be shaken, and then laying down a piece of
canvas, or coarse cloth, to keep the place
clean, while she rakes out the ashes, takes
them up, and brushes up the fire-place. She
then rubs the bright bars of the stoves, and
the fire-irons, first with oil, and afterwards
with emery-paper, No. 3, or with brick-dust,
till clean and bright—and, finally, with scouring-paper;
and this should be done in the
summer time, particularly when the stoves
may have acquired spots for want of constant
use.</p>

<p>The backs and sides of the fire-places are
next to be brushed over with black-lead, and
then rubbed dry and bright with a hard brush
kept for the purpose.</p>

<p>The fires are next lighted, and the marble
hearths washed with flannel, dipped in a
strong hot lather of soap and water, which
must be cleaned off and wiped dry with a
linen cloth;—the marble chimney pieces need
not be thus cleaned above once or twice a
week.</p>

<p>Common free-stone hearths may be scoured
with soap and sand and cold water, and afterwards
rubbed dry with a clean house cloth.</p>

<p>By this time the footman will have done all
his work in the pantry, and have rubbed all
the tables, chairs, cellerets, and other mahogany
furniture, and cleaned the brass and
other ornaments, the mirrors, looking-glasses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>
&amp;c. in these rooms, when the carpets are to
be swept, on ordinary occasions, with a carpet
mop to take off the flue, lint, and dust;
or more thoroughly, once a week with a long
hair-brush or carpet-broom, first having
strewed them over with damp tea-leaves, (see
receipt for scouring and cleaning carpets.) The
sides of the carpet are then turned up all
round the room, and the dust on the floor
swept away, or, occasionally, the floor scoured
with soap and water. The carpet is then
turned back again; the chairs and other furniture
dusted singly, and removed from the
middle of the room, where they were cleaned
to their proper places.</p>

<p>The window curtains and hangings may not
require to be shaken and dusted every day,
but the dust on the windows should be removed
with a long hair-broom, and the cobwebs
or any dirt on the ceiling, and in the
corners of the room, must be sought for and
removed.</p>

<p>Every thing being adjusted in the rooms for
the reception of the family, the house-maid
next opens the shutters of the dining-room,
and drawing-room, where she and the footman
regularly proceed with their respective
business in the manner above mentioned. The
house-maid with the fires and fire-place,
floors, carpets, &amp;c. scouring, washing, brushing,
and dusting them; and the footman, rubbing
and cleaning the mahogany furniture,
looking-glasses, and other articles in his department,
till all is made quite clean, and
the rooms are fit for the reception of the
family.</p>

<p>At an appointed time she repairs to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
dressing-rooms of the master and mistress,
and others in use, empties the slops, replenishes
the ewers and water-carofts with
fresh spring and soft water, and fills the kettles
for warm water—cleans up the fire-places,
lights the fires, brushes the carpets, sweeps
the rooms, dusts the furniture, and puts the
rooms in order before the lady’s-maid and
valet come to make their arrangements previous
to the rising of their superiors.—Having
done these, she sweeps down the principal
stair-case and goes to her breakfast.</p>

<p>As soon as the best bed-rooms and dressing-rooms
are at liberty, she repairs thither,
puts out the fires, or not, according as the
weather is,—throws open the windows, (or
the doors only, in unfavourable weather) to
air the rooms, and the beds; opens all the
beds, throws the bed-clothes off, on the backs
of chairs, placed at the foot of the bed,
shakes up each bed, and then proceeds to
her other business in the rooms, in order
to give as much time as can be spared for
airing the beds. Meanwhile, she cleans up
the fire-places, again, lays the fires to be
ready when wanted, and having washed her
hands and put on a clean apron, she makes
the beds. (In this business she is usually assisted
by the under house-maid, as it requires
two persons to make a bed well.) This done,
she mops or brushes the carpets, to clean off
the flue or feathers and dust,—sweeps out the
rooms, rubs and dusts the furniture, supplies
the ewers and carofts with clean water, and
then retires; leaving the rooms properly arranged
against the coming of the lady’s-maid
and valet to prepare for their master’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span>
and mistress’s dressing, previous to their going
out.</p>

<p>She next proceeds to the other bed-rooms—opens
the windows and makes the beds—empties
the slops—cleans out the rooms, rubs
and dusts the furniture, and puts them in
proper order.</p>

<p>Having finished all the bed-rooms, the stair-cases,
landings, and passages, will next claim
her attention, which are also to be swept, the
carpets brushed or swept, and the floor-cloths
rubbed over with a clean wet flannel, and
wiped dry with a clean house-cloth. On the
appointed general cleaning days, the floor-cloths
must be scoured with warm soap suds,
and afterwards wiped dry, with a clean linen
cloth.</p>

<p>On the general cleaning days also, which
are usually Tuesdays and Saturdays, every
branch of the household work must be
thoroughly done, in the best manner;—the
rooms are then to be scoured instead of being
merely wiped or swept;—the carpets are
to be well brushed or taken up to be beaten
or shaken;—the stoves and fire-places brightened
and cleaned with particular care;—the
marble hearths and chimney-pieces scoured;—the
mahogany furniture and the brass or
other ornaments in the best rooms, and the
mirrors and looking-glasses cleaned, with
more than ordinary attention;—the bed-furniture,
window-curtains and hangings well
shaken, whisked and brushed: in short, the
best practical methods for thoroughly cleaning
the whole house, must be resorted to on
that day.</p>

<p>If the house maid rise in good time, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span>
employ herself busily, she will get every thing
done above stairs in time to clean and make
herself comfortable for dinner, about one
o’clock; after which she will attend to her
needle work, under the direction of the housekeeper.
About four, in the winter, the fires in
the dressing-rooms are to be lighted—the
slops emptied—clean water supplied, (hot and
cold) and the dressing-rooms again dusted
and cleaned, preparatory to the lady and gentleman
dressing for dinner. While the family
is at dinner, the dressing-rooms must be again
prepared; and in the evening the shutters of
the bed-rooms and dressing-rooms must be
fastened—the curtains let down—the beds
turned down—the fires lighted, and the rooms
put into proper condition for the night. Wages
from 12 to 16 guineas a year.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN CARPETS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>First well beat and brush the carpet,—then to a gallon of
water add eight potatoes grated, and with this liquid wash
it slightly over with a sponge, which will not only clean it
but restore it to its original beauty when dry. Or, after it
has been well beaten and brushed, put an ox gall into a pint
of water, wash the carpet over on the right side, and it will
have the same effect.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO SCOUR CARPETS, HEARTH-RUGS, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Rub a piece of soap on every spot of grease or dirt;
then take a hard brush dipped in boiling water, and rub the
spots well. If very dirty, a solution of soap must be
put into a tub, with hot water, and the carpet well beat in
it, rinsing it in several clean waters, and putting in the last
water a table-spoonful of oil of vitriol, to brighten the colours.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO DUST CARPETS AND FLOORS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Carpets should not be swept with a whisk-brush more
than once a week; at other times sprinkle tea-leaves on
them, and sweep carefully with a hair-broom, after which they
should be gently brushed on the knees with a clothes’-brush.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN ALL SORTS OF METAL.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mix half a pint of refined neat’s-foot oil, and half a gill of
spirits of turpentine; wet a woollen rag therewith, dip it
into a little scraped rotten-stone, and rub the metal well.
Wipe it off with a soft cloth, polish with dry leather, and
use more of the powder. If steel is very rusty, use a little
powder of pumice with liquid, on a separate woollen
rag, first.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO RESTORE HANGINGS, CARPETS, CHAIRS, &amp;C.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Beat the dust out of them as clean as possible, then rub
them over with a dry brush, and make a good lather with
Castille soap, and rub them well over with a hard brush,
then take clean water and with it wash off the froth;
make a water with alum, and wash them over with it, and
when dry, most of the colours will be restored in a short
time; and those that are yet too faint, must be touched up
with a pencil dipped in suitable colours; it may be run all
over in the same manner with water colours mixed well with
gum water, and it will look at a distance like new.</p>

the paper, to be cleaned by means of a good pair of bellows,
begin at the top of the room, holding the crust in the hand,
and wiping lightly downwards with the crumb, about half a
yard at each stroke, till the upper part of the hangings is
completely cleaned all round; then go again round with the
like sweeping stroke downwards, always commencing each
successive course a little higher than the upper stroke had
extended, till the bottom be finished. This operation, if carefully
performed, will frequently make very old paper look
almost equal to new. Great caution must be used not by
any means to rub the paper hard, nor to attempt cleaning
it the cross or horizontal way. The dirty part of the bread
too must be each time cut away, and the pieces renewed as
soon as necessary.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO WHITE WASH.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Put some lumps of quick-lime into a bucket of cold water,
and stir it about till dissolved and mixed, after which a brush
with a large head, and a long handle to reach the ceiling of
the room, is used to spread it thinly on the walls, &amp;c. When
dry it is beautifully white, but its <i>known cheapness</i> has induced
the plasterers to substitute a mixture of glue size and
whiting for the houses of their opulent customers; and this,
when once used, precludes the employment of <i>lime-washing</i>
ever after; for the latter, when laid on whiting becomes
yellow.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">White-washing is an admirable manner of rendering the
dwellings of the poor clean and wholesome.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO PRESERVE POLISHED IRONS FROM RUST.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Polished iron-work may be preserved from rust by a mixture
not very expensive, consisting of copal varnish intimately
mixed with as much olive oil as will give it a degree of
greasiness, adding thereto nearly as much spirit of turpentine
as of varnish. The cast iron-work is best preserved by
rubbing it with black-lead.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">But where rust has begun to make its appearance on grates
or fire-irons, apply a mixture of tripoli with half its quantity
of sulphur, intimately mingled on a marble slab, and laid on
with a piece of soft leather: or emery and oil may be applied
with excellent effect, laid on with a spongy piece of
the fig-tree fully saturated with the mixture. This will not
only clean but polish, and render the use of whiting unnecessary.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN MARBLE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take verdigris and pumice-stone, well powdered, with
lime newly slacked. Mix with soap lees, to the consistence
of putty. Put it in a woollen rag, and rub the stains well
one way. Wash off with soap and water. Repeat, if not
removed.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN FLOOR-CLOTHS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Sweep them and wipe them with a damp flannel, after
which wet them all over with milk, and rub them till bright
with a dry cloth.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">N. B. Floor-cloths should be chosen that are painted on
fine cloth, well covered with colour and perfectly dry. The
durability of the cloth depends greatly on these points, and
particularly on its having had time for the paint to get quite
dry. Old carpets answer extremely well, if painted and
hung up to season some time, before they are laid down for
use.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN LOOKING-GLASSES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO TAKE SPOTS OF GREASE OR OIL OUT OF BOARDS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Drop a few drops of oil of turpentine on the spots and
rub it hard with your finger; this will dissolve the grease,
and make it mix with the soap (or suds) and water when the
room is washed.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Another Way.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Mix together fuller’s-earth and soap lees, and rub them on

strong soft soap and sand, or use lees to scour it with. It
should be put on hot, by heating the lees.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE SERVANT OF ALL WORK.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> small families where only one female servant
is kept, the servant of all work will be
required to do all the work of the house, which
in large establishments is very properly divided
into several departments.</p>

<p>This description of servant is usually taken
from the industrious and labouring classes of
the community, who are bred up with a
view to the situation, having no other prospect
or dependence; and are taught, from
their earliest age, to assist in the management
of the house, the care of the younger children,
preparing the meals, making the beds, scouring,
washing, and in every other branch of domestic
business:—In short, no girl ought to
undertake, or can be qualified, for such a
situation, who has not been thus bred up.
And if, in addition to these preparatory qualifications,
she comes from a sober, well-disposed
family, and is of a tractable disposition,
there can be but little doubt of her acquiring
the good-will of her master and mistress, of
qualifying herself for a superior service, and
of finally succeeding in her sphere of life.</p>

<p>She will receive her first instructions from
her mistress, or probably from the former
servant, as to the peculiarities of the
house, and will very soon, with attention,
become versed in all.</p>

<p>Industry and cleanliness, with a determination
to be useful, and to please, will speedily
overcome all difficulties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[286]</span></p>

<p>To rise early is indispensably necessary.
“Those who would thrive, must rise by five.”
And, recollect, that “the servant who begins
her work late, will have to run after it all the
day, but will never overtake it.”</p>

<p>Every morning, the first business will be
to light the kitchen fire, brush up and clean
around the grate and fire-place, take up
the ashes, sweep the floor and hearth, and
having made all quite clean, rinse out the tea-kettle,
and set it on the fire, with clean spring
water, preparatory to the family breakfast;
and also another kettle to heat water for
household purposes. She next takes the tray,
carpet-broom, hair-broom, hearth-rug, a
clean dry duster, and the basket or box, containing
the brushes, rags, leathers, brick-dust,
scouring-paper, and other things for cleaning
the grate and fire-place, and proceeds to the
parlour, or sitting-room, to get that in order,
before the family comes down to breakfast.
She begins there by clearing away the candlesticks,
dirty glasses, and such other things as
may have been left there the preceding night.
She then rolls up the hearth-rug, so that no dirt
or dust may drop from it, as it is carried out
to be shaken; she next turns back the carpet,
with the drugget, baize, or other covering,
if any, and lays down a piece of canvas, or
coarse cloth, to keep the place clean; after
which she rakes out the ashes from the grate,
takes them up, and brushes up the dust and
dirt; then rubs the bright bars of the grate,
and the fire-irons, with emery paper, No. 3,
or brick-dust; or if there be very fine steel
stoves, fenders, &amp;c. they should be first rubbed
with oil, then with emery, till clear and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[287]</span>
bright, and afterwards with scouring paper,
which is an excellent article to use every second
or third day in summer-time, when
stoves are not in constant use, as it will take
off all the spots they may have acquired.</p>

<p>After the stove and fire-irons are cleaned,
and the back and sides of the hearth are washed
over with black-lead mixed with water, and
rubbed dry and bright with a hard brush,
light the fire, and proceed to wash the marble
hearth.</p>

<p>For this purpose, take a piece of flannel
dipped in a strong, hot, lather of soap and
water, and having washed off the dirt, wipe
it dry with a clean linen cloth. The jambs and
chimney-piece need only be cleaned thus, once
or twice a week, or as the custom of the family
may be. Soap and sand, with cold water, will answer
for washing free-stone hearths, &amp;c. which
must be afterwards wiped dry with a clean
house-cloth. The next business will be to
clean the brass locks, finger-plates, and other
brass furniture; for which see the receipt.—If
the locks are stiff, or hang, put a very little
sweet oil on the bolts with a feather; the
same ought to be done occasionally to the
hinges, latches, bolts, and locks of every
door in the house. A few minutes thus employed,
when necessary, will prevent most of
the disagreeable noises of creaking hinges,
rusty bolts, and useless locks.</p>

<p>For the finger-plates, and other brass ornaments
about the room, you must have pieces
of pasteboard, with holes cut in them of the
size of the respective articles, to prevent soiling
or rubbing the door or furniture to which
they are fixed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span></p>

<p>The carpet next requires attention; this
must generally be swept with the carpet-mop,
to clean off the lint and dust, but, occasionally
with the carpet-broom, or long hair-broom,
first strewing it over with a few damp tea-leaves,
(which should always be saved for the
purpose, when the tea-things are washed up.)
Then remove the chairs, and other furniture,
to the middle of the room, turn up the sides
of the carpet, and sweep up all the dust and
flue round the sides of the room before replacing
the carpet.</p>

<p>Always rub and dust the chairs, tables, and
other mahogany furniture, in the middle of
the room, and return them to their places, one
by one, as you finish them; this will prevent
your scratching or soiling the walls or wainscot.
The window-curtains and hangings may
not require to be shaken and brushed every
day, but the windows should be brushed with
the long hair-broom, and cobwebs and other
filth, on the ceiling, and upper corners of the
room, should be occasionally sought for, and
removed. When she has swept the room, and
rubbed and dusted the furniture, she must
dust the window-frames, ledges of the wainscot,
and doors, chimney-pieces, glass, china,
and other ornaments, and having seen that
every article is in its proper place, stir the
fire, and taking all her brushes, &amp;c. leave
the room perfectly clean, and fit for the reception
of the family at breakfast. She next
proceeds (if the parlour be up stairs) to sweep
and dust the stairs, which she does one by
one, sweeping the dust from each into the
dust-pan, and afterwards dusting the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
windows and balustrade as carefully as she had
done the room.</p>

<p>She should also sweep the passage in the
same way. The floor-cloth in the passage,
for the daily cleaning, need only to be swept
and rubbed with a damp flannel first, and
afterwards with a dry one. The steps, at the
front door, should be cleaned every morning,
after the passage is swept out, and the street-door
and the knocker, &amp;c. must be cleaned or
polished. The kitchen stairs also, and the
steps at the back-door, if any, are to be
cleaned. Above all, the kitchen must now
be put in order.</p>

<p>She then washes her hands and face, and
puts on a clean apron, &amp;c. so as to be cleanly
before the parlour bell rings for breakfast.
Directions for setting out the breakfast table
will be found in the Instructions to the Footman,
as well as for dinner, lunch, tea, &amp;c.</p>

<p>As soon as the family is seated at breakfast,
she throws open the bed-room doors and
windows, and uncovers the beds to be aired,
and placing the bed-clothes across a chair at
the foot of the bed, leaves them in that state
till breakfast is finished, when she proceeds to
make the bed.</p>

<p>On going down, she takes the slop-pails,
night-candlesticks, and the water-ewer and
carofts to be filled with fresh water, and
brought up again immediately, lest they should
be wanted. When she goes up after breakfast,
if there have been fires, the fire-places
must be swept up, the fires laid, and before
she makes the beds, she should wash
her hands and put on a clean apron. Every
bed should be well shaken daily, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span>
mattresses turned, at least, once a week. The
head of the bed, the curtains, vallance, &amp;c.
will often require attention; when they should
be brushed with a whisk-brush, and well
shaken, the bed-side carpets having been
first taken up. After she has made the beds,
and before the carpets are laid down again,
the chairs, glasses, and other articles of furniture
in each room are to be properly rubbed
and dusted, and the floors swept clean. The
sleeping rooms being thus prepared, and the
stairs swept down, she will scarcely have occasion
to go up again till evening, when she
turns down the beds, lets down, or draws the
curtains, and puts the rooms in order for the
night.</p>

<p>At intervals, she will, perhaps, be called to
bring coals for the parlour fire, in the winter
time; (see directions to the footman;) but, in
addition to this, little will occur to take her
from the regular routine of the morning’s
work, till the preparation for dinner requires
her attention. She will find ample instructions
for the care of the kitchen and larder,
and for dressing dinners, under the directions
to the cook.</p>

<p>If she is required to wait at table, she will
find instructions for the purpose in the directions
to the footman. After the dishes,
&amp;c. and the cloth and table-cover are removed,
when there is no company present,
her mistress will, perhaps, require her to
bring a piece of cloth, with bees’-wax on it, and
a hard furniture brush, to rub the dining-table,
and take out the stains of the hot dishes.</p>

<p>When all things are set right in the parlour,
as her mistress may direct, she will get her
own dinner, (which she will contrive to keep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[291]</span>
as warm as circumstances will allow;) meanwhile
the water must be heating to wash the
dishes, and all the kitchen utensils, which
being washed, and the several articles (particularly
the tinned ones) wiped out clean and
dry, they are to be put away, always in their
proper places, in the cleanest and nicest order,
and fit for immediate use.</p>

<p>This done, she is to make up the fire, (having
due regard to the very expensive article of
coals) and put on the kettle for tea. The kitchen
is next to be set to rights, and every article
in and about it is to be made quite clean, and
disposed in perfect order. In fact, the cleanly
and orderly state of the kitchen ought, at all
times, to claim her utmost attention, as it is
there that all the food of the family is prepared,
and nothing does, nor, indeed, can,
more deservedly contribute to the good character
of a servant, than the well-regulated
state and cleanly appearance of her kitchen.</p>

<p>The situation of a servant of this denomination
is, as we have seen, one continued
round of activity, but industry becomes habitual,
and she will reap the benefit of it
throughout life. To be content is the main
thing, and others, seeing her good tempered,
and disposed to be happy, will study to make
her so; while experience and habit will greatly
contribute towards it, by daily rendering the
routine of the service more familiar, and consequently,
more easy.</p>

<p>There are times, however, when the regular
course of business will be interrupted.
Once a week is the appointed day for a thorough
scouring and cleaning, viz. Saturday. But even
this day is rendered less formidable by an attentive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span>
servant, and by a little charitable consideration
in the mistress, (which is generally the
case) who will contrive that there shall be less
of the ordinary business of the family to be
done on that day than on any other. The
maid will, perhaps, manage to get the bed-rooms
thoroughly scoured on Friday. This
should be done as early in the day as possible,
and in the winter, fires should be made in the
rooms, in order that they may be quite dry
and safe by bed-time. For cleaning calico
and other bed-furniture, and for scouring
rooms, see Head House-Maid. The Sitting-room,
and the spare rooms, if any, instead of the
usual every-day cleaning, should now be thoroughly
cleaned, the floors scoured, the grates,
hearths, chimney-pieces, carpets, curtains, and
furniture rubbed, scrubbed, dusted, and otherwise
cleaned in the best manner; the kitchen, it
is presumed, is already clean—<i>always clean</i>;
the pots, pans, kettles, and every other culinary
utensil being <i>always cleaned as soon as
done with;—scoured, wiped out dry, and put
away in their proper places, fit for use at a
moment’s notice</i>. However laborious the work
of the Saturday may appear, it is but getting
up an hour or two earlier, and setting about it
with a good heart, and all the extra business
of the house, in every part, is completely
finished, and you sit down, in the evening,
to tea, rejoicing that all is comfortable, and
in order.</p>

<p>Another, and more laborious deviation from
the regular routine of family business is—the
appointed “<i>Washing-day</i>,” which is, indeed,
a day of bustle and activity; perhaps the only
one that can be called a hard day’s work, from
one washing-day to another. But, here also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>
if the intervals between the washings be long,
a washer-woman will be hired, and the mistress
will probably lend her aid, in sorting
the clothes, getting up the small linen, ironing,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>In proportion to the arduous and active duties
of a situation, is the satisfaction to be enjoyed
from a regular and attentive discharge
of those services: hence no servant has it in
her power to render herself and her employers
more comfortable, than the maid of all work.
By a methodical division of her time, she is
enabled to keep in order every apartment in
the house, from the kitchen to the attic, all of
which may be accomplished without any extraordinary
effort on her part: and while she
thus promotes the comforts of her master and
mistress by her industry and regularity, they
will not be backward in rewarding those meritorious
qualities. Wages from 8 to 12 guineas.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO LIGHT AND MANAGE A PARLOUR FIRE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">There is more art, perhaps, and more economy than is
considered necessary in making well, and managing a fire.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">First rake out all the ashes, quite clean, leaving in the
bottom of the grate a few light cinders, through which the
air, from beneath, may pass freely; upon these lay shavings,
or waste paper, and then the wood, the smaller pieces under,
of course, and the whole crossing each other promiscuously,
and in all directions; throw cinders behind, and
some at the sides, to fill out the grate, and in the front, betwixt
the bars, put small knobs of fresh coals, with some
larger knobs at top, and a little small coal behind, but not
so much at first as to prevent a draft of air through the
grate at the top. The fire, thus prepared, may be lighted
with a match, and will kindle well of itself, whilst the ashes
are taken up, and the fire-place cleaned. When it is found
necessary to blow a fire, do not thrust the nose of the bellows
between the bars, but keep it at an easy distance from
the fire, and rather below the centre of the fire, that so, the
air may be dispersed around to a considerable distance
in front of the fire. When you stir a fire, always put
the poker between the second and third bars.—After you
have stirred the fire, rake out the ashes at the bottom of
the grate, and sweep up the hearth.</p>

should be kept perfectly neat, and cold water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
should be frequently thrown over it.—There
should be shutters to the Dairy to keep out
the sun and hot air.</p>

<p>The cows should be milked at a regular and
early hour, and their udders should be <i>perfectly
emptied</i>, else the quantity given will be
diminished. When you go to the cow, take
with you, <i>cold water</i> and a sponge, and wash
each cow’s udder; bathe it well with cold
water, both in winter and summer, as that
braces them and repels heat. But, if any cow
has sore teats, let them be soaked in warm water
twice a day, and either dressed with soft ointment,
or bathed with spirits and water. In
either case, the milk should be given to the pigs.</p>

<p>When the milk is brought into the Dairy, it
should be strained and emptied into clean
pans, immediately, in winter, but not till cool,
in summer. Suffer no one to milk the cows
but yourself, as much depends on their being
<i>dripped quite clean</i>, particularly after a calf is
taken away.</p>

<p>The quantity of milk given by cows, will be
different according to their breed, health, pasturage,
the length of time from calving, and
other circumstances. Change of pasturage will
tend to increase the quantity.</p>

<p>In good pastures, the average of each cow
will be about three gallons a day from Lady-day
to Michaelmas; and thence to Christmas, one
gallon a day.</p>

<p>Cows will be profitable yielders of milk, to
fourteen or fifteen years of age, if of a good
breed. They should be fed well two or three
weeks before calving, which will increase the
quantity of milk. In gentlemen’s Dairies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[297]</span>
more attention is paid to the beauty and size of
cows, than to their produce.</p>

<p>It is absolutely necessary that the cows should
be kept feeding whilst you are milking them.</p>

<p>It should be contrived that cows kept for a
gentleman’s family, should calve at different
seasons, and, particularly, that one or two
should calve in August or September, to insure
a supply of milk in winter.</p>

<p>When there is not a great demand for cream
in the family, the Dairy-maid will take that
opportunity to provide for the winter store.
She should keep a regular weekly account of
the quantity of milk given by each cow, and
the quantity of butter she pots. The average
of a good fair Dairy cow, during several
months after calving, will be seven pounds of
butter a week, and from three to five gallons
of milk per day; afterwards, a weekly average
of three or four pounds of butter, from barely
half that quantity of milk. On an average,
three gallons of good milk, will yield one
pound of butter. The annual consumption of
a good cow, turned to grass, is from an acre
to an acre and a half in the summer, and from
a ton to a ton and a half of hay, in the winter.
Each cow should be allowed two pecks of carrots
per day. The grass, if cut and carried to the
cows green, will economize full one-third.</p>

<p>Alderney cows yield rich milk, upon less
food, than larger cows, but are seldom large
milkers, and are particularly scanty of produce
in the winter.</p>

<p>Wages from 8l. to 12l. a year.—Perquisites,
1d. per pound for butter; 1½d. for each chicken,
or fowl killed; 2d. each, for ducks, geese,
and turkeys; and 3d. a score for eggs.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO PRESERVE MILK.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Provide bottles which must be perfectly clean, sweet, and
dry; draw the milk from the cow into the bottles, and as
they are filled, immediately cork them well up, and fasten
the corks with pack-thread or wire. Then spread a little
straw on the bottom of a boiler, on which place the bottles
with straw between them, until the boiler contains a sufficient
quantity. Fill it up with cold water; heat the water,
and as soon as it begins to boil, draw the fire, and let the
whole gradually cool. When quite cold take out the bottles,
and pack them with straw or saw-dust in hampers, and stow
them in the coolest part of the house. Milk preserved in this
manner, although eighteen months in the bottles, will be as
sweet as when first milked from the cow.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO MANAGE YOUNG CHICKENS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The chickens first hatched, are to be taken from the hen,
lest she be tempted to leave her task unfinished. They may
be secured in a basket of wool or soft hay, and kept in a
moderate heat, if the weather be cold, near the fire. They
will require no food for 24 hours, should it be necessary to
keep them so long from the hen. The whole brood being
hatched, place the hen under a coop abroad, upon a dry
spot, and, if possible, not within reach of another hen,
since the chickens will mix, and the hens are apt to destroy
those which do not belong to them. Nor should they be
placed near young fowls, which are likely to crush them, being
always eager for their small meat.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The first food should be split grits, afterwards tail wheat,
all watery food, soaked bread, or potatoes, being improper.
Eggs boiled hard, or curd chopped small, is very suitable
as first food. Their water should be pure and often renewed,
and there are pans made in such forms, that the chickens
may drink without getting into the water, which, by wetting
their feet and feathers, numbs and injures them; a bason in
the middle of a pan of water, will answer the end; the water
running round it. There is no necessity for cooping the
brood beyond two or three days, but they may be confined
as occasion requires, or suffered to range, as they are much
benefited by the foraging of the hen. They should not be
let out too early in the morning, whilst the dew lies upon the
ground, nor be suffered to range over wet grass, which is a
common and fatal cause of disease in fowls. Another caution
requisite is to guard them against unfavourable changes
of the weather, particularly if rainy. Nearly all the diseases
of fowls arise from cold moisture.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">For the period of the chickens quitting the hen, there is no
general rule; when she begins to roost, if sufficiently forward,
they will follow her; if otherwise, they should be secured in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>
a proper place, till the time arrives when they are to associate
with the other young poultry, since the larger are sure
to overrun and drive from their food the younger broods.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO FATTEN POULTRY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">An experiment has lately been tried of feeding geese with
turnips, cut in small pieces like dice, but less in size, and put
into a trough of water; with this food alone, the effect was,
that six geese, each when lean weighed only 9&#160;lbs., actually
gained 20&#160;lbs. each in about three weeks fattening.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Malt is excellent food for geese and turkeys; grains are
preferred for the sake of economy, unless for immediate and
rapid fattening; the grains should be boiled afresh.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Other cheap articles for fattening, are oatmeal and treacle;
barley-meal and milk; boiled oats, and ground malt.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Corn before being given to fowls should always be crushed
and soaked in water. The food will thus go further, and
it will help digestion. Hens fed thus have been known to lay
during the whole of the winter months.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO DETERMINE THE ECONOMY OF A COW.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The <span class="smcap">annual product</span> of a good fair dairy cow, during several
months after calving, either in summer or winter, if duly
fed and kept in the latter season, will be an average of seven
pounds of butter per week, and from five to three gallons of
milk per day. Afterwards, a weekly average of three or
four pounds of butter from barely half the quantity of milk.
It depends on the constitution of the cow, how nearly she
may be milked to the time of her calving, some giving
good milk until within a week or two of that period, others
requiring to be dried 8 or 9 weeks previously. I have heard
(says Mr. Lawrence) of 20&#160;lbs. of butter, and even 22&#160;lbs.
made from the milk of one long-horned cow in seven days;
but I have never been fortunate enough to obtain one that
would produce more than 12&#160;lbs. per week, although I have
had a Yorkshire cow which milked 7 gallons per day, yet never
made 5&#160;lbs. of butter in one week. On the average 3
gallons of good milk will make 1&#160;lb. of butter.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO MAKE SALT BUTTER FRESH.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">To every pound of salt butter put a quart of new milk,
and a little arnotto. Churn it an hour, then take it out and
treat it as fresh butter, by washing it with water, and add
the usual quantity of salt. The butter gains about three
ounces in the pound.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">SUBSTITUTE FOR MILK AND CREAM.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Beat up the whole of a fresh egg, in a basin, then pour
boiling tea over it gradually, to prevent its curdling. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span>
difficult, from the taste, to distinguish the composition from
rich cream.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO PRESERVE EGGS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Apply with a brush a solution of gum-arabic to the shells,
or immerse the eggs therein; let them dry, and afterwards
pack them in dry charcoal dust. This prevents their being
affected by any alterations of temperature.</p>

or tub full of holes, over which lay a coarse cloth or sieve.
On the top of the whole put a wooden cover, with a weight
sufficiently heavy to press out the liquor from the bran, which
will sink to the bottom of the tub in a thick pulp. This
liquor will contain the essential oil of the corn, and when
kneaded in with half a hundred weight of flour, and the usual
quantity of salt and yeast, it will yield one-third more
bread than the same quantity of flour would, made with
water in the usual way. Divide into middle sized loaves and

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[301]</span></p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE CHAMBER NURSE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Every</span> experienced person, and every liberal
physician and medical man, is sensible of the
value of a careful, skilful, and kind-hearted
nurse, and that the alleviation of sickness and
the actual cure of diseases, depend as much on
the anxious attention of the nurse, as on the
efficacy of medicine itself. Good temper, patience,
watchfulness, and sobriety, are the cardinal
virtues of every good nurse, and when possessed
by one who unites skill with those personal
qualities, she is a treasure above all price.</p>

<p>Although the chamber nurse forms no part
of the establishment of healthy families, yet
as in every family she is a necessary auxiliary
for longer or shorter periods, a brief notice of
her qualifications and duties, will confer
completeness on such a volume as the present.</p>

<p>The chamber or sick nurse should be qualified
for her duty by some experience; and if
her experience has been considerable, and she
is a woman of good understanding, she will
prove herself quite as important in the nursery
of the sick, as medical practitioners, or
all the drugs in an apothecary’s shop. She
ought to be past the middle age, and if a married
woman or widow, so much the better.
She ought to be clean in her person, and neat
in her dress, and free from habits of drinking
or snuff-taking. She ought also to be a woman
of cheerful and equable temper, and,
above all things, free from superstition, or
belief in charms, omens, signs, dreams, and
other follies of gross ignorance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[302]</span></p>

<p>The sick room should be clean, well aired,
and free from noisome smells; and, on the contrary,
the air should be purified by sprinkling
vinegar or eau de cologne, and occasionally
burning a little vinegar in a heated shovel.</p>

<p>Quietness, in every respect, is of the first
consequence. Fire irons should be avoided:
creaking doors and locks should be oiled; and
list shoes constantly worn. Talking loud and
whispering, so as to excite the suspicion of
the patient, should be equally avoided; and a
long feather should be pushed through the
key-hole, as a signal on the outside, when the
patient is asleep. The nurse should only sleep
when the patient sleeps, as one means of preventing
the patient being awoke by her frivolous
activity.</p>

<p>In cases of contagion, whatever is sent out
of the room, should be immersed in water,
and the nurse should be careful not to receive
the breath of the patient, nor to sit on the bed.
She should also carry about her person a bag
of camphor, and during such diseases, frequently
fumigate the room with vinegar, and
indulge occasionally in half a glass of brandy.</p>

<p>The sick chamber should be provided with
a lamp and appurtenances, for heating whatever
may be wanted; with a tea kettle, two or
three saucepans, empty bottles for hot water,
(to put to the feet,) some sal volatile and spirits,
a bottle of salts, and of eau de cologne; some
lambs-wool gloves to rub the patient, a bed-pan,
a foot-bath, or a large tin bath; some
lemonade, barley-water, and toast and water:
oranges, lemons, and empty medicine bottles,
which occasion smells that infect the air,
should be kept in an adjoining room. There<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span>
should also be a supply of flannel, old linen,
and napkins, for every purpose. Different
medicines should be carefully kept apart; lest
pernicious ones be given, or proper ones,
at improper times. A thermometer in the
room is the only means of keeping an equal
temperature, or increasing or diminishing it,
as the medical attendants may direct.</p>

<p>The reports of the nurse to the physician,
and the observations of the physician, should
always be made in an adjoining room, and the
mind of the patient not be distracted by details
of symptoms, and of the nurse’s business.
Changes which take place after the visit of the
medical attendant, should be immediately reported,
and in all that regards the administration
of the medicines, and the general system
of treatment, the nurse should scrupulously
obey the instructions of the medical advisers,
not only as the most likely means of promoting
the speedy recovery of the patient, but to
remove from herself all responsibility and
blame. At the same time, she should not
withhold her opinion, in regard to the effect of
the medicines administered, and in her conferences
with the medical advisers, should
suggest whatever appears likely to be useful.</p>

<p>Nurses, according to the length of a disease,
are paid by the day, week, or month; and
as boarders in the family, they ought not to
take advantage of the sympathy which induces
the relatives of the sick to afford them every
indulgence, so as to involve unnecessary or
wanton expenses; but consider the interest
of the family, whose affliction requires their
attendance, as their own. The usual payment
of a nurse in London, is from 10s.&#160;6d. to 15s.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[304]</span>
per week, according to the circumstances of
the parties, and of the case.</p>

<p>Nurses who have to compound and administer
Family Medicines must be prepared with
proper scales and weights; and with graduated
glass measures, such as are used by Apothecaries;
according to the following</p>

these flannels are alternately applied, so as to
keep the affected part constantly warm. This is continued
fifteen or twenty minutes, and repeated two or three times

for twenty-four hours in a little warm water; expose it to
heat over the fire, to dissipate the greater part of the water,
and supply its place by colourless brandy, which will mix
the gelatine of the glue. Strain the whole through a piece

fix it in that position by means of tacks, or pack-thread.
Then, with a brush made of badger’s hair, apply the glue,
after it has been exposed to a gentle heat, to render it liquid.
When this stratum is dry, which will soon be the case, apply
a second, and then a third, if necessary, to give the plaster
a certain thickness; as soon as the whole is dry, cover it with
two or three strata of a strong tincture of balsam of Tolu.</p>

sharp instruments, bring the lips of the wound together, and
lay over it a piece of goldbeater’s skin; then fix this by
means of a piece of court plaster. The wound will generally
heal without further trouble.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Rub the camphor first with the spirit of wine, then with
the sugar; lastly, add the water by degrees, and strain the
mixture.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In the common form of camphor emulsion the union is
effected, by triturating the camphor with a few almonds,
the unctuous quality of which serves in a considerable degree
to cover the pungency of the camphor without diminishing
its activity. Camphor under the present form,
as well as that of emulsion, is very useful in <i>fevers</i>, taken
to the extent of a table-spoonful every three or four hours.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This is a very elegant form of exhibiting chalk, and is a useful

proceeding from that cause.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO RELIEVE FAINTING AND OTHER FITS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The person ought to be immediately carried into the open
air, and the temples should be rubbed with strong vinegar
and brandy, and volatile salts or spirits held to the nose.
The patient should then be laid on the back with the head
low, and have a little wine or other cordial poured into the
mouth. If subject to hysteric fits, castor or assafœtida
should be applied to the nose, or burnt feathers, horn, or
leather.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO RELIEVE SUDDEN BLEEDING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Dry lint put up the nostrils, pledgets of lint dipped in

twenty drops of oil of turpentine taken in water, generally
stop discharges of blood.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO MAKE A WARM BATH.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Water for a warm bath should be rather more than a
blood heat, or from 90 to 100 of the thermometer, and if
a portable tin bath is not at command, and a warm bath is
suddenly wanted, the quickest mode of making one, is to
knock in the head of a beer or wine cask, according to the
size of the patient, and every neighbourhood will supply
these, as well as sufficient quantities of hot water, clean or
dirty.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO RESTORE SUSPENDED ANIMATION.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">In cases of substances being stopt between the mouth and
the stomach, where they cannot be extracted by the fingers
or otherwise, the person should swallow a piece of meat or
tow tied to a thread, which should be immediately drawn
up again. Emetics are sometimes serviceable, and injections
of warm milk and water frequently remove the obstructions.
When animation is suspended by noxious vapours,
the usual methods in fainting should be employed,
and lemonade or vinegar and water given to the patient as
soon as he can swallow.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When it proceeds from extreme cold, the part affected
should be immersed in cold water, or rubbed with snow till
they recover their natural warmth.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO RELIEVE AN APOPLECTIC FIT.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Every method should be taken to lessen the circulation of
blood towards the head; the patient should be kept easy
and cool, the head raised high, and the feet suffered to hang
down. The clothes should be loosened and fresh air admitted
into the room, and medical assistance procured immediately
for bleeding.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Apoplexy is preceded by giddiness, pain, and swimming
of the head, loss of memory, &amp;c. and on the symptoms appearing,
bleeding, slender diet, and opening medicines are
advisable, and often act as preventives.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO EASE OR CURE HEAD-ACHES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Most head-aches arise from imperfect digestion, either
from acidity, or from accumulations of bile. The first cause
may be removed by half a tea-spoonful of carbonate of
soda, or by a dessert spoonful of magnesia, in a small tumbler
of water. But if the cause is bilious, then two or three
antibilious pills, or a pill of from two to five grains of calomel,
is the best remedy, and this may be assisted in its operation
by half an ounce of salts in a large tumbler of water,
in the morning. Washing the head with cold water, is always
salutary in habitual head-aches, particularly at rising
in the mornings.</p>

drams of verdigris, melt them together, and spread the
composition on a piece of soft leather or linen; cut away as

a quart of water, likewise makes an admirable wash for a

keep it moist with the alum water for two or three days,
without removing the bandage.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO EXTINGUISH FIRE WHICH MAY HAVE CAUGHT THE
CLOTHES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The mischief which arises from this accident is owing to
the party standing in an erect position, because flame ascends,
and feeds and accumulates in intensity during its
ascent. The first remedy is, therefore, to lay the child or
other person on the floor, in which position the flames will
not only make no progress, but will do little or no harm to
the person. The fatal consequences of this accident arise from
the ascent of the flame to the throat, head, and sensitive
organs, an effect which cannot take place if the body is instantly
placed in an horizontal position. Sir Richard Phillips,
who first promulgated this treatment, proved its efficacy
by taking two strips of muslin, a yard long, and one of them,
which was set on fire at the end, and held perpendicularly,
burnt out with an intense flame in less than half a minute;
but the other piece, laid hollow and horizontally, on being
set on fire at the end, burnt even with difficulty, and twenty
minutes elapsed before it was entirely consumed; the flame
at the same time being inconsiderable and harmless.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">After the person on fire has been laid horizontally, the
best method of extinguishing the fire, is an immediate covering
of any kind, and when every spark has been extinguished,
spirits and water, or vinegar and water, should be
applied to affected parts till the pain is removed. Adult
females, whose clothes take fire, should have the presence of
mind instantly to throw themselves on the floor, and in that
case, no serious injury can ever arise, and if this precaution
were generally known, many families would have been relieved
from the unavailing affliction of the loss of dear
connexions, and from the heart-rending scenes which, under
other circumstances, they have been fated to witness.</p>

warm room. Let it be instantly stripped, dried, and wrapped
in hot blankets, which are to be renewed when necessary.
Keep the mouth, nostrils, and the throat free and
clean. Apply warm substances to the back, spine, pit of
the stomach, arm pits, and soles of the feet. Rub the body
with heated flannel, or warm hands.—Attempt to restore
breathing, by gently blowing with bellows into one nostril
closing the mouth and the other nostril. Keep up the application
of heat. Press down the breast carefully with
both hands, and then let it rise again, and thus imitate natural
breathing. Continue the rubbing, and increase it when
life appears, and then give a tea-spoonful of warm water,
or of very weak wine or spirits and warm water. Persevere
for six hours. Send quickly for medical assistance.</p>

THE LAND STEWARD AND BAILIFF.
</p>


<p>To form a complete <span class="smcap">land steward</span>, it is
requisite that theory and practice should be
combined. By consulting books we profit
by the experience of other men, enlarge our
own sphere of thinking, and add more, perhaps,
to our stock of knowledge in a short
space of time, than could be acquired by long
and laborious practice. No land steward or
even ordinary farmer should be without
<i>Young’s Farmer’s Calendar</i>, the last edition
of which, improved by Middleton, contains a
body of valuable information; but Mr. Lawrence
on this subject, with great propriety, recommends
the reading of Tull and Miller, as the
great originals on tillage; Ellis on sheep and
other live stock; and the Surveys of the several
Counties of the Kingdom, made, and published
by the Board of Agriculture.</p>

<p>To these, for a further knowledge in the
treatment of live stock, may be recommended a
perusal of our best veterinary treatises. We
must also recommend Sir John Sinclair’s Code
of Agriculture, as a companion to Middleton’s
edition of Young’s Calendar, and these, with
Mackenzie’s Receipt Book, ought to be the
standing literary furniture of every steward’s
room.</p>

<p>The land steward should never undertake
more business than he can faithfully and properly
execute, and therefore should have no
other occupation or profession to attend; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[328]</span>
mere collecting of rents and giving discharges
being the least considerable part of his duty.</p>

<p>On his first entering into office, he should
make a general survey of all the estates and
property entrusted to his care:—he should
also form an inventory, and open a set of
books on a clear and perspicuous plan, if not
already done by his predecessor, taking care
to enter in them a correct list of all the books,
writings, deeds, schedules, court-rolls, &amp;c.
From this survey, whether left by his predecessor,
or taken by himself, regular memorandums
should be made in a book, of every
thing necessary to be remarked or executed,
of the places where deficiencies are found, or
improvements may be made; of buildings and
repairs necessary; insurances, dates of leases,
rates, nuisances, trespasses, live and dead
stock, game, timber, fencing, draining, paths,
and roads, culture, commons, rivers, and sea
coasts, and of every other specific article relative
to his trust, which deserves attention,
and therefore ought not to be committed to
loose papers, or left to memory.</p>

<p>He should endeavour to gain a practical
knowledge of the characters and conduct of
inferior servants, taking nothing upon trust;
but observing with his own eyes their performances
early and late. A faithful steward
will lose no time in detecting the peculations,
and counteracting the combinations among
those servants who are under his controul,
which may be prejudicial to the estate of his
principal; and of replacing them with servants
of fair character, to whom ample wages should
be allowed; and the job work, or more profitable
kinds of labour, should be impartially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[329]</span>
dealt out to them, that so, all may be equally
benefited, and equally satisfied.</p>

<p>Every farm, when surveyed, should be correctly
described in a map, of which the tenant
should have a copy. A Terrier should also be
kept of the commonfield-lands, for the satisfaction
of the tenant as well as the lord, and
where the bounds of any parcel of land are
dubious, they should be fixed, and properly
marked out, by a jury impannelled at the manor
court. The boundaries of the parish and
precincts should also be ascertained, and the
particular property of the lord kept entire,
by the annual custom of perambulation on Holy
Thursday, and its concomitant ceremonies.
The steward should frequently ride round and
make an eye survey of the estates, in order to
obviate any disputes,—to prevent encroachments,
and to afford timely advice and assistance
if necessary. He should see that all repairs
are duly and substantially performed
according to covenant, ditches cast and scoured,
water courses kept free, common rights
fairly enjoyed, according to the custom of the
manor, the commons not overstocked by one,
in prejudice to others, observe that the underwood
be cut at the stated periods, that the
trees are properly lopped and topped without
damage to the lord, that the wood-wards do
watch and report all trespasses by cattle and
otherwise, and to discourage poaching and the
destruction of game, by all fair, moderate, and
rational means.</p>

<p>The tenants should not be suffered to let
their lands be over-run by moles—nor the
commons and woodlands by swine unrung.</p>

<p>The strictest caution should be used to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[330]</span>
prevent all the produce of the estates, that is
fit for manure or other useful purposes, from
being alienated or carried off.</p>

<p>An eye ought always to be kept on the surveyor
of the highways of the neighbouring
parishes, to see that no nuisance exists, or
bridge or highway be neglected.</p>

<p>Trespasses from stray cattle ought to be
prevented, and if necessary punished, as well
as the depredations of dogs, which often do
much injury to the farmer.</p>

<p>It behoves the steward to support, and cause
to be recognized, all the ancient manorial
rights and privileges that are usually respected.</p>

<p>Heriots accruing from copyhold estates, ought
not to be taken in kind, but a moderate fine
should be levied in lieu thereof.</p>

<p>Encouragement should be given to improvements
in cultivation. The best heads of cattle
should be introduced, and any successful
mode of culture recommended among the
tenantry. They should also be stimulated to
plant fruit-trees, as means of adding to the
produce without encumbering the land.</p>

<p>The transactions of the steward should always
be pure, incorruptible, and free even
from suspicion. He ought not to sell preference,
either for money or for any indirect consideration,
such concession to him being in
effect a robbery on the tenant, or on his employer,
who is entitled to all the advantages
which can accrue from his estate. If a sum
of money is covertly given for preference in a
lease, then the lease is worth so much more,
and the proprietor is defrauded of the difference.
Nothing can be more pernicious to an
estate than such underhand transactions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[331]</span>
Modest industry and merit are thereby subverted
by the audacity of knaves, and the steward,
from the moment he has thus sold himself
becomes a dependent on the honour of the parties.
Preference given to kin ought also to be
avoided, and every nobleman and gentleman is
justified in being jealous of the introduction
of his steward’s kindred upon his estate, often
to the great prejudice of his old and attached
tenants.</p>

<p>Many stewards become the tyrants of their
vicinity by an impertinent interference with
the domestic economy of the families of the
tenants, presuming to prescribe in regard to
their dress, habits, and amusements, seeming
thereby to consider them as vassals, instead
of freemen, to whose industry their landlord
is indebted for his ease and luxury. With
these affairs the steward has no concern, and
every farmer and his family should be left to
their own discretion in such particulars, if
they pay with regularity the average rent of
their vicinity, and do not manifestly deteriorate
the estate; they are, and ought to be, in all
their domestic and personal concerns, and also
in their opinions, religious and political, as
independent of the steward, or of his employer,
as these parties are of them. His interference
has, in truth, tended to retard the
civilization of the agricultural classes, and, in
many districts, placed them one or two centuries
behind the inhabitants of towns. The
steward, therefore, who forbears to meddle
with what does not properly concern him, will
enjoy the love of tenantry, and that affection
will always best promote the interest of his
employers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[332]</span></p>

<p>Whilst the steward is not unmindful of every
possible improvement, he should keep in view
every appearance of the existence of minerals
or metals, that so the needful essays or experiments
may be made under the superintendance
of persons of experience and fidelity.
Proximity to the sea coast, navigable rivers,
canals, or great towns, will much enhance the
value of such discoveries.</p>

<p>Every opportunity should be embraced of
letting land on building leases, as a means of
greatly improving the value of estates; the
fitness by means of water and roads for the
establishment of a manufactory, or a village,
or, by being near the sea coast, for a fishery,
are objects too important to be overlooked by
a faithful and intelligent agent.</p>

<p>It has already been remarked, that the land
steward should not be engaged in any business
that would detract from that attention which
is required in the faithful discharge of the duties
of his office; and even in performing those
engagements, he should occasionally be assisted,
in cases of importance, where he may
consider his own knowledge not sufficient,
by an able professional adviser. He will
most require this aid in the making of leases,
deeds, agreements, and other legal instruments.</p>

<p>The balance of cash, which may often be
considerable, ought not be allowed to lie idle
in the house. All money is part of the vital
blood of society, and should be kept in circulation.
This may be effected either by lodging
it at a country bank, where moderate interest
will be allowed for it, or by discounting
the notes of respectable tenants, who, at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[333]</span>
certain turns of the season, are often in want of
ready money, and their notes will, in many
cases, serve as cash payments for other purposes,
or they may be made to fall due at
periods when cash will be wanted, while it
will thus be accumulating at five per cent.
No risk need be incurred in such transactions,
while the accommodation would add much to
the prosperity of the estate. If the steward
reside in London, spare cash may, in like manner,
be employed at a full rate of interest, by
discounting such good bills as are always to
be met with at the principal brokers in and
about Lombard Street; and these bills will be
received by the bankers as they arrive at
maturity. By this means 3 or 4 per cent may
always be added to the income of a nobleman
or gentleman, or sufficient to pay the wages
of all the servants.</p>

<p>In the business of accounts, the first objects
are, arrangement, perspicuity, and security.
In all accounts of property, there are certain
general rules which must be attended to, the
chief of which are the following: 1st. Trust
as little as possible to memory, but make memorandums
of payments, receipts, bargains,
agreements, &amp;c. on the instant. 2d. Pay no
money without receiving a proper discharge.
3d. Give up no security, lease, agreement, or
other valuable property, without taking in
return a written acknowledgement. 4th. Let
all contingent, undecided, or uncertain transactions
be forthwith entered, with every necessary
remark, voucher, and reference. 5th.
Post all the various transactions under their
proper heads as soon as possible. 6th. Fold,
label, date, and class all papers, the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[334]</span>
valuable of which are to be deposited at the
end of every year, in a secure place, with
the date on the outside. Perhaps the two
principal books necessary to be kept, are a
<span class="smcap">day-book</span> or <span class="smcap">journal</span>, and a <span class="smcap">ledger</span>, with
two other books, to be called the <span class="smcap">memorandum-book</span>,
and <span class="smcap">general inventory</span>. A portable
<span class="smcap">pocket memorandum-book</span> will also be
found to be convenient. Every servant in trust
under the land steward ought to be provided
with an account book appropriately ruled: this
book should be examined and passed monthly
by the steward and an abstract of it transcribed
into his journal.</p>

<p>The journal, spoken of, should be kept as a
book of reference for every transaction that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[335]</span>
occurs, and which is to be entered daily, precisely
as it occurs; and if it be afterwards found
necessary, is to be entered in the ledger as
a distinct and separate account—from all
others. This journal will, of course, include
every cash transaction, and save the trouble of
keeping a separate cash-book. The cash account
may be posted regularly in the ledger,
under a general head, bearing that title.</p>

<p>In the ledger will, of course, be opened an
account with every tenant, and as a consequence
with <i>Dr.</i> and <i>Cr.</i>; also an account <i>Dr.</i>
and <i>Cr.</i> of every article, the increase, decrease,
and actual state of which, it is necessary to
ascertain with precision.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">memorandum ledger</span> being paged,
and having an alphabet, is for the purpose of
containing the head title of every memorandum
of consequence, and pointing out the
page, in the journal, where the particulars are
to be found. This ought to be examined frequently,
and the items that are become useless,
marked out; those remaining unmarked,
should, if numerous, be carried forward. The
regular, or occasional deposits of leases, deeds,
and other documents of importance, are invariably
to be pointed out by a memorandum,
as it may be of great import to successors and
survivors.</p>

<p>From these original sources, transcripts
may be made in any form required, for the use
of the principal or lord. An account current
of cash received and paid should be made out
annually, half-yearly, or otherwise, to be examined,
passed, and signed by the principal.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE HOUSE STEWARD.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is the most important officer in domestic
establishments, and is seldom adopted
except in the families of noblemen or
gentlemen of great fortunes, by whom he is
appointed as their <i>locum tenens</i>, not only to
superintend such necessary business as, from
their rank and condition, or other circumstances,
they cannot undertake, but also to
control and manage, generally, all the most
important concerns of the household. It
follows, therefore, that he ought to be a man
of great experience in household affairs, steady
and attentive in his conduct, and of approved
principles and integrity. His character must
be irreproachable and exemplary, that he may
be regarded with confidence and satisfaction
by his employers, and respected by those
around him.</p>

<p>His chief business will be to hire, manage,
and direct, and discharge every servant of
every denomination. To appropriate to every
domestic his proper and express business, and
to see that it be done accordingly. He ought
to make it a point never to take a servant
without strict enquiry as to his moral character,
orderly conduct, and abilities for his situation,
nor ought he to withhold a fair character
from any servant he discharges.</p>

<p>The House Steward, by the suavity of his
manners, and equable deportment, has it in
his power to sustain the reputation of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[337]</span>
master in high estimation, and to make his
whole household comfortable and happy.</p>

<p>For further hints respecting servants we refer
to the Address to the <i>Mistresses of Families</i>,
in the dedication, <a href="#Page_10">p. 10, 11, and 12</a>; and to
those given to the <i>Housekeeper</i>, <a href="#Page_52">p. 52, 53, and
54.</a></p>

<p>Ability to provide for the family in the best
manner, is another qualification indispensably
necessary in the <i>House Steward</i>. He is expected
to be a competent judge of the nature
and qualities of provisions, their comparative
values, the best seasons for purchasing the
several articles, and the cheapest and most
economical markets or places to attend. The
best way to go to market is with <i>ready money</i>;
or to deal with tradesmen of probity, and to
settle their accounts early and at regular and
stated periods, but never to disappoint them,
at the expected times, which makes his custom
nearly equivalent to cash, and he will
consequently be served with the best articles
and on the lowest terms. A conscientious and
honest discharge of his duty in this respect,
will tend greatly to the satisfaction of his employers,
and redound to his own credit. Other
hints on the subject will be found under the
head Housekeeper, <a href="#Page_54">p. 54 and 55</a>; and directions
for marketing, which may afford some
hints, even to an expert and an adroit practitioner,
may be found <a href="#Page_75">p. 75 to 88</a>.</p>

<p>The abilities of the House Steward, as an
accountant, are not required to be very considerable.
He is merely to keep an account of
monies received by him, on one page, and of
monies paid or disbursed by him, on the opposite
page; and these two pages being cast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[338]</span>
up, and the amount of one side being deducted
from the amount of the other, will, if the account
has been correctly kept, shew at once
the exact balance, belonging to his employer,
remaining in his hands. It will be the business
of the housekeeper to examine, weigh,
and compare the several articles, as they are
brought in, with the tickets sent with them by
the respective tradesmen, and these tickets, so
examined and signed, will enable the Steward
to check the tradesmen’s bills when brought
in, previously to their being paid. An upright
and trust-worthy Steward will discharge
this part of his duty, as well as every other,
with zeal, fidelity, impartiality, and integrity;
bearing for ever on his mind this pleasing truth,
that, “every man’s station is honourable or
otherwise, as his own conduct makes it.”</p>

<p>Salary from 100l. to 250l. and upwards.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE STEWARD’S ROOM BOY.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is seldom a lad of this description
kept, except in families where there is a house
steward, or comptroller of the household,
when the servant is appointed to attend on
him, run on errands, carry messages, &amp;c. He
waits at table, or makes himself otherwise
useful in the steward’s-room; trims the lamps
that are in use below stairs, and cleans the
servants’ boots and shoes. Wages from 8l.
to 12l. per annum.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[339]</span></p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE BUTLER.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> first rising, it is the duty of the Butler,
where no valet is kept, to manage and arrange
his master’s clothes, and carry them to his
dressing-room, his boots and shoes being
cleaned by the footman or under butler.</p>

<p>It is his proper business to see that the
breakfast is duly set, the under butler or footman
carrying up the tea urn, and the butler
the eatables; he, or the under butler waiting
during breakfast.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> On taking away, he removes
the tea-tray, and the under butler or
footman the urn, cloth, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The breakfast things being taken away, and
the plate, &amp;c. cleaned and put away under his
directions, the Butler then gets his own breakfast
with the housekeeper, unless the servants
all breakfast together at an earlier hour.</p>

<p>If no valet is kept, he then attends in his
master’s dressing-room, sets it in order, carries
down his clothes to be brushed by the
under butler or footman, and attends to every
thing connected with his master’s clothes,
linen, &amp;c. or sees that what is wanted is done
by others.</p>

<p>He now cleans himself to attend company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[340]</span>
or visitors at the door, which he is to answer,
receive cards, deliver messages, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At luncheon time, the cloth being laid by
the under butler or footman, it is the duty of
the Butler to carry in the tray, or arrange the
table, and when there is company, he waits in
the room assisted by the other servants.</p>

<p>If wine is wanted for the luncheon, it is his
duty to fetch it from the cellar; and if ale, to
draw or bring it up when wanted.</p>

<p>The keys of the wine and ale cellars are
specially kept by him, and the management
of the wine, the keeping the stock book, and
also of ale in stock, or in brewing, are in his
particular charge. This duty he generally
performs in the morning before he is drest to
receive company, and he then brings out such
wine as is wanted for the day’s use. It is his
duty to fine wine as it comes in the pipe,
and to superintend the bottling, sealing it
himself, and disposing it in binns so as to know
its age and character. While these duties and
those of brewing are in hand, he leaves the
parlour and waiting duties to the under butler
and footman.</p>

<p>Where no steward is kept, he pays all bills
for wine, spirits, ale, malt, coals, and in general,
all bills not in the housekeeper’s or kitchen
department. Sometimes, also, he pays
the other male servants.</p>

<p>At dinner time, the under butler or footman
lays the cloth, and carries up the articles
wanted, under the direction of the Butler, who
gives out the necessary plate, kept by him
under lock, and generally in an iron chest.</p>

<p>He sets and displays the dinner on the table,
carrying in the first dish, waits at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[341]</span>
side-board, hands wine round or when called
for; removes every course, and sets and arranges
every fresh course on the table according
to his bill of fare, which is placed on the
side-board for reference; and does not leave
the dinner room till the dessert and wine have
been placed on the table by him or under his
direction.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>It is then his business to see that the plate,
glasses, &amp;c. are carried to the pantry, cleaned,
and wiped by the under butler and footman,
and the whole carefully put in their proper
places.</p>

<p>Having taken his own dinner with the other
servants out of livery, generally at one o’clock,
he gets his tea while the family in the parlour
are taking their wine and dessert, and in the
mean time, the under butler or footman prepares
the tea things for the parlour.</p>

<p>If the bell rings during the dessert, the
Butler answers, and does the same for the remainder
of the evening.</p>

<p>The under butler is now engaged in cleaning
the plate and arranging the pantry.</p>

<p>The tea tray is carried up by the Butler, assisted
by the footman; and in waiting at tea,
the Butler hands round the cups on the tray,
the footman assisting with the eatables. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[342]</span>
Butler removes the tea-tray, and the footman
the urn, &amp;c. The footman carries in coals,
but the Butler manages the candles.</p>

<p>When tea is made below, it is done by the
housekeeper, but carried up and handed round
by the Butler and footman.</p>

<p>If there is company, the refreshments,
wine, ices, &amp;c. are carried up by the Butler,
assisted and followed by the footman.</p>

<p>When there is supper, the under Butler or
Butler arranges the same, and it is managed
like the dinner.</p>

<p>Slippers, dressing gown, night candles, &amp;c.
are carried up and disposed by the Butler.</p>

<p>After his master has gone to bed, he goes
to his dressing-room, takes down such things
as want cleaning or brushing, and gives them
to the footman. He then looks over the
plate, locks it up, sees that all the men servants
are gone to bed, the doors locked, and
windows fastened, and then retires to rest himself.</p>

<p>This business is strictly domestic, but he
goes out to order things in his department,
and he is sometimes employed abroad in any
confidential business, to which the under servants
are considered unequal.</p>

<p>The wages of regular Butlers, in large families,
are from 50 to 80l. per annum; but in
smaller families, from 30 to 50l. The perquisites,
if he perform the duty of valet, are
his master’s cast off clothes; and as Butler,
he gets the pieces of wax candles, the second
hand cards, compliments on paying tradesman’s
bills, or Christmas boxes and wine for
his own use. He finds his own clothes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[343]</span>
washing, &amp;c. and is expected to be genteel and

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> principal object to be attended to in
the management of foreign wine vaults, is to
keep them of a temperate heat. Care must
be taken, therefore, to close up every aperture
or opening, that there may be no admission
given to the external air. The floor of the
vault should likewise be well covered with
saw-dust, which must not be suffered to get too
dry and dusty, but must receive now and then an
addition of new, lest, when bottling or racking
wine, some of the old dust should fly into
it. At most vaults, in the winter, it is necessary
to have a stove or chafing-dish, to keep
up a proper degree of warmth. In the summer
time it will be best to keep them as cool
as possible.</p>

well about, and this will make a pipe of good mild Lisbon:
or, if it be desired to convert mild into dry, take the same
quantity out as above mentioned, before, and fill the pipe
with Malaga sherry, stirring it about as the other. The same

froth, and mix it with a little of the wines; then pour it
into the pipe, stir it about, and let it have vent for three

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO IMPROVE WINE BY CHALK.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[352]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Add a little chalk to the <i>must</i>, when it is somewhat sour;
for the acidity arising from citric and tartaric acids, there
is thus formed a precipitate of citrate and tartrate of lime,
while the <i>must</i> becomes sweeter, and yields a much finer
wine. Too much chalk may render the wine insipid, since
it is proper to leave a little excess of acid in the <i>must</i>.
Concentrate the <i>must</i> by boiling, and add the proper quantity
of chalk to the liquor, while it is still hot. Even acid
wine may be benefited by the addition of chalk. Oyster-shells
may be used with this view; and when calcined are a
cleaner carbonate of lime than common chalk.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>To Renovate Sick Wine.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Wines on the fret should be racked; if their own lees indicates
decay they should be racked on the sound lees of
another wine of similar, but stronger quality, to protract
their decline; if this be done at an early period, it may
renovate the sick wine; on these occasions, giving the
sick wine a cooler place, will retard its progress to
acidity; if convenient, such wines should be forced and
bottled. Previous to bottling, or rather at the forcing,
give it one, two, or three table-spoonsful of calcined gypsum
finely pulverised. This will check its tendency to acidity,
without exciting much intumescence, without injuring
the colour of the red wine, and without retarding its coating
to the bottle, which it rather promotes. The proper forcing
for red wines are, the whites of ten or twelve eggs, beat up
with one or two tea-spoonsful of salt per hogshead, and well
worked into the wine with a forcing-rod; the gypsum should
be first boiled in a little water. This is intended to check
the acetous process. To retard the vinous, the French are
in the habit of burning sulphur immediately under the cask,
and possibly the sulphuric acid evolved by the combustion,
may check its progress and prevent the necessity of an <i>admixture</i>.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>To Mellow Wine.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Cover the orifices of the vessels containing it with bladders
closely fastened instead of the usual materials, and an
aqueous exhalation will pass through the bladder, leaving
some fine crystallizations on the surface of the wine, which,
when skimmed off, leaves the wine in a highly improved
state of flavour. Remnants of wine covered in this manner,
whether in bottles or casks, will not turn mouldy, as
when stopped in the usual way, but will be improved instead
of being deteriorated.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>German method of restoring sour Wines.</i></p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>To Concentrate Wines by Cold.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">If any kind of wine be exposed to a sufficient degree of
cold in frosty weather, or be put into any place where ice
continues all the year, as in ice-houses, and there suffered to
freeze, the superfluous water contained in the wine will be
frozen into ice, and will leave the proper and truly essential
part of the wine unfrozen, unless the degree of cold should
be very intense, or the wine but weak and poor. When the
frost is moderate, the experiment has no difficulty, because
not above a third or fourth part of the superfluous water
will be frozen in a whole night; but if the cold be very intense,
the best way is, at the end of a few hours, when a
tolerable quantity of ice is formed, to pour out the remaining
fluid liquor, and set it in another vessel to freeze again
by itself.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The frozen part, or ice, consists only of the watery part of
the wine, and may be thrown away, and the liquid part retains
all the strength, and is to be preserved. This will
never grow sour, musty, or mouldy, and may at any time be
reduced to wine of the common strength, by adding to it as
much water as will make it up to the former quantity.</p>

this, when cold, becomes a stiff jelly. Whisk up some of

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>To render Red Wine White.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">If a few quarts of well-skimmed milk be put to a hogshead
of red wine, it will soon precipitate the greater part of the
colour, and leave the whole nearly white; and this is of
known use in the turning red wines, when pricked, into
white; in which a small degree of acidity is not so much
perceived.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Milk is, from this quality of discharging colour from
wines, of use also to the wine-coopers, for the whitening of
wines that have acquired a brown colour from the cask, or
from having been hastily boiled before fermenting; for the
addition of a little skimmed milk, in these cases, precipitates
the brown colour, and leaves the wines almost limped,
or of what they call a water whiteness, which is much coveted
abroad in wines as well as in brandies.</p>

floors. Before a tempest of thunder, it will be advisable to

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Get some fresh oyster-shells, wash them and scrape off
the yellow part from the outside; lay them on a clear fire till
they become red hot; then lay them to cool, and take off
the softest part, powder it, and sift it through a fine sieve;
after which use it immediately, or keep it in bottles well

too fine or close, and sloping, so as to have the bottom of it
run to a point, and the top as broad as the cloth will allow.
It must be well sewed up the side, and the upper part of it
folded round a wooden hoop, and well fastened to it; then
tie the hoop in three or four places with a cord to support it;
and when used, put a can or pail under it to receive the
liquor, filling the bag with the sediments; after it has ceased
to run, wash out the bag in three or four clear waters, then
hang it up to dry in an airy place, that it may not get musty.
A wine dealer should always have two bags by him, one for
red, and the other for white wines.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When wine is made fine and pleasant, it may be bottled,
taking care afterwards to pack it in a temperate place with
saw-dust or leather. After which it will not be fit to drink
for at least two months. Never use new deal saw-dust, as
that causes the wine to fret, and often communicates a strong
turpentine smell through the corks to the wine.</p>

cold, mix them with an equal quantity of cream of tartar;
put this mixture into a strong bottle with common water to
boil for one hour, and then decant into ounce phials, and
add 20 drops of muriatic acid to each; this liquor precipitates
the least quantity of lead, copper, &amp;c. from wines in a
very sensible black precipitate.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>To Detect Alum in Wine.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Wine merchants add alum to red wine, to communicate to
it a rough taste and deeper colour; but this mixture produces
on the system the most serious effects. For the discovery
of the fraud in question, adopt the following means:—The
wine is to be discoloured by means of a concentrated
solution of chlorine; the mixture is to be evaporated
until reduced to nearly the fourth of its original volume;
the liquor is to be filtered; it then possesses the following
properties when it contains alum:—1st. It has a sweetish astringent
taste; 2d. it furnishes a white precipitate (sulphate
of barytes) with nitrate of barytes, insoluble in water and
in nitric acid; 3d. caustic potass rise to a yellowish white
precipitate of alumine, soluble in an excess of potass; 4th.
the sub-carbonate of soda produces a yellowish white precipitate
(sub-carbonate of alumine) decomposable by fire
into carbonic acid gas, alumine, easily recognisable by its
characters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Procure some soft straw or hay to pack them in, and if
they are to be sent a long way, and are heavy, the hay or
straw should be a little damp, which will prevent them slipping
about. Let the largest and heaviest things be always
put undermost in the box or hamper. Let there be plenty of
straw, and pack the articles tight; but never attempt to
pack up glass or china which is of much consequence, till you
have seen it done by some used to the job. The expense will
be but trifling to have a person to do it who understands it,
and the loss may be great if articles of much value are packed
up in an improper manner.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN WINE DECANTERS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Cut some brown paper into very small bits, so as to go
with ease into the decanters; then cut a few pieces of soap
very small, and put some water, <i>milk-warm</i>, into the decanters,
upon the soap and paper: put in also a little pearl ash;
by well working this about in the decanters it will take off the
crust of the wine, and give the glass a fine polish. Where
the decanters have had wine left to stand in them a long time,
take a small cane with a bit of sponge tied tight at one end:
by putting this into the decanters any crust of the wine may
be removed. When the decanters have been properly
washed, let them be thoroughly dried, and turned down in a
proper rack.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">If the decanters have wine in them when put by, have
some good corks always at hand to put in instead of stoppers;
this will keep the wine much better.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO DECANT WINE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Be careful not to shake or disturb the crust when moving
it about, or drawing the cork, particularly Port wine. Never
decant wine without a wine-strainer, with some fine cambric
in it, to prevent the crust, and bits of cork going into
the decanter. In decanting Port wine do not drain it too
near; there are generally two-thirds of a wine glass of thick
dregs in each bottle, which ought not to be put in; but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[359]</span>
white wine there is not much settling; pour it out however
slowly, and raise the bottle up gradually, the wine should
never be decanted in a hurry, therefore always do it before
the family sit down to dinner. Do not jostle the decanters
against each other when moving them about, as they easily
break when full.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO MIX A SALAD.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Always inquire before you mix a salad, how your master
or mistress would like to have it done. If no particular
method be pointed out to you, adopt the following, which
has been much approved of. Let the salad be well washed
and dried in a cloth before you cut it up; save a part of the
celery with a little beet-root and endive for ornament in the
middle of the dish: cut the rest small as well as the lettuce
and mustard and cresses, and put to it the following mixture:
take the yolk of an egg boiled hard, rub it quite smooth
with a table-spoonful of oil and a little mustard; when they
are well mixed together add six spoonsful of milk or cream,
and when these are well mixed, put six or seven spoonsful of
vinegar to the whole, and mix it all together with the salad.
Never make the salad long before it is wanted, as it becomes
flat with standing.</p>

two powders there mentioned, the two following are used:
for one glass, 30 grains of carbonate of soda; for the other, 25
grains of tartaric (or citric) acid.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO MAKE GINGER BEER.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO PREPARE GINGER BEER POWDERS.</p>

them intimately in a Wedgwood’s-ware mortar. Take also
27 grains of citric or tartaric acid, (the first is the pleasantest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[360]</span>
but the last the cheapest.) The acid is to be kept separate
from the mixture. The beer is prepared from the powders
thus: take two tumbler glasses, each half filled with water,
stir up the compound powder in one of them, and the acid
powder in the other, then mix the two liquors, when an effervescence
takes place, the beer is prepared and drank
off immediately.</p>

from ignorance of the preservative effect produced on it by
charring the casks previous to their being filled, it may be
rendered perfectly sweet by putting a little fresh charcoal in

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE VALET.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> duties of this servant are not so various
nor so important as those of the footman;
indeed, they are very frequently, and particularly
in small families, a part of the business
of a footman. The particular province of the
valet is to attend to the personal accommodation
of his master. He waits on him when
dressing and undressing, has the care of his
wardrobe, brushes and keeps his clothes in
good order and ready to put on when wanted.
For this purpose every garment or other article
of wearing apparel, should be carefully
examined, cleaned or brushed on the first opportunity
that offers, and then put away in its
proper place.</p>

<p>He should chuse the earliest part of the
morning to clean the boots and shoes, unless
it be otherwise arranged, and brush the
clothes, and to do all such work, so as to be
able to get to his master’s dressing-room
time enough to make the necessary arrangements
there before he expects him to rise.
He will see that the housemaid has lighted the
fire, and cleaned out and dusted the rooms;
will prepare the washing-stand, fill the ewer
with clean soft water, and the caroft with fresh
spring water.—The basin and towels, the hair,
nail, and tooth-brushes clean, and in their
proper places; hot water, and all the necessary
apparatus for shaving, quite ready; his
dressing-gown and slippers airing before the
fire; and his clean linen perfectly well aired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[362]</span>
by himself, before it be considered as fit to be
put on. The coat, trowsers, &amp;c. intended to
be worn must be taken out and placed at
length across the backs of chairs, the sleeves
and outsides turned inward, with a clean linen
or brown Holland wrapper thrown over them,
to save them from dust. Having once ascertained
the way in which these things are to be
done, he will find it easy in future, and will
be sure to please. The best way to hang up
a coat is, to fold it once at full length, with the
inside outward, the sleeves put straight, and the
two fronts together, and then hang it on a
cloak-pin by the inside of the shoulder.</p>

<p>If the wardrobe be sufficiently large to hold
each kind of garment separately, it will be so
much the better, as the coats and other articles
may then be laid in smoothly and at
length, as soon as they are brushed and cleaned,
and a brown Holland cloth may be spread
over each drawer or shelf, to preserve them
from the dust.</p>

<p>Gentlemen who shave themselves, usually
strop their own razors immediately after the
operation, whilst the metal is yet warm,
which is the best way: but if it be left to the
valet to do, the razor must be dipped in warm
water and wiped dry with a clean cloth or rag;
then laying it flat on the strop, draw it diagonally,
from the heel to the point, the whole
length of the strop, turning the elbow in and
out every time the razor is turned; half a dozen
or half a score strokes backwards and
forwards, as often as it is used, will keep it in
good order for a considerable time. Good
razors are made concave, or hollow, between
the back and the edge, on both sides, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[363]</span>
greater security in shaving, and for the purpose
of giving them a better edge in setting or
stropping.</p>

<p>Having attended his master while dressing,
combed his hair, &amp;c. the valet will take the
first opportunity, after he is gone, to set the
room in order, by looking over his things,
folding away his night clothes, washing the
brushes and combs occasionally, when necessary,
with warm water and soap, wiping
them clean, and drying them at an easy distance
from the fire, and then putting them
away in their places.—The dressing-stand
must be wiped clean and dry, the basin washed
and wiped, the ewer and caroft rinsed out
and filled again with clean water, the towels
taken away and replaced with clean ones,
the fire stirred, the room dusted, and every
thing put in order, as if immediately to be
used again. This must always be done as soon
as possible after his master is dressed or re-dressed,
and every garment or other article
that has been taken off, must be brushed,
folded, and put away in its proper place.</p>

<p>In case of the master’s coming home wet
from a ride, or otherwise, an immediate change
of warm dry clothes must be provided, and
the wet or damp things taken away and dried
at a proper distance from the fire; after having
wiped the coat, or other woollen garments,
with a sponge, the way of the nap, or, if only
spotted, with a silk handkerchief, in the same
manner, which will effectually smooth the
grain of the cloth, and remove all the spots.</p>

<p>When preparing for a journey, care should
be taken to ascertain the probable time of absence,
that sufficient change of linen, &amp;c. may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[364]</span>
be provided—nor must the shaving and dressing
apparatus be forgotten. When arrived
at an inn, or visiting place, all his master’s
things must be carried into his dressing-room,
and set in order for dressing, or for the night,
as nearly as possible in the same order as at
home. If the footman be not there, the valet
will have to attend to his master’s accommodation
below stairs also.</p>

<p>The valet is to be always in attendance, in
case of his master’s coming home unexpectedly—and
he is to assist in waiting at table at all
meal-times.</p>

<p>As the valet is much about his master’s person,
and has the opportunity of hearing his off-at-hand
opinions on many subjects, he should
endeavour to have as short a memory as possible,
and, above all, keep his master’s council;
and he should be very cautious of mischief-making
or tale-bearing, to the prejudice
of other persons, as calculated to involve his
master in disputes, and ruin himself, if by
chance he is incorrect.</p>

<p>The usual salary is from 30l. to 60l. per annum,
but in some situations much more. Perquisites,
his master’s cast-off clothes.</p>

a little boiling water; with a hard brush, dipped in this
liquor, brush spotted places. Then dip the coat in a bucket
of cold spring water. When nearly dry, lay the nap right,
and pass a drop of oil of olives over the brush to finish it.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">If grey, drab, fawns, or maroons, cut yellow soap into
thin slices, and pour water upon it to moisten it. Rub the
greasy and dirty spots of the coat. Let it dry a little, and

dried fulling-earth and powdered alum, and pass them over
on each side with a common stiff brush: then sweep it off,
and sprinkle them well with dry bran and whiting, and dust
them well; this, if they be not exceedingly greasy, will render
them quite clean; but if they are much soiled, take out
the grease with crumbs of toasted bread, and powder of
burnt bone: then pass them over with a woollen cloth, dipped
in fulling-earth or alum powder; and in this manner they
can be cleaned without wetting, which frequently shrinks

it out and add a small piece of green copperas, and boil it
another half hour. Hang it in the air for an hour or two,
then rinse it in two or three cold waters, dry it and let it be

<p class="takeof-noindent">Portable balls for removing spots from clothes, may be
thus prepared. Fuller’s earth perfectly dried, (so that it
crumbles into a powder,) is to be moistened with the clear
juice of lemons, and a small quantity of pure pearl-ashes is
to be added. Knead the whole carefully together, till it
acquires the consistence of a thick elastic paste: form it into
convenient small balls, and dry them in the sun. To be used,
first moisten the spot on the clothes with water, then rub it
with the ball, and let the spot dry in the sun; after having
washed it with pure water, the spot will entirely disappear.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN GOLD LACE AND EMBROIDERY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">For this purpose alkaline liquors are not to be used; for
while they clean the gold they corrode the silk, and change
or discharge its colour. Soap also alters the shade, and even
the species of certain colours. But, spirit of wine may be
used without any danger of its injuring either colour or quality;
and, in many cases, proves as effectual for restoring
the lustre of gold, as the corrosive detergents. But, though
spirit of wine is the most innocent material employed for
this purpose, it is not in all cases proper. The golden covering
may be in some parts worn off; or the base metal,
with which it has been alloyed, may be corroded by the air,
so as to leave the particles of gold disunited; while the silver
underneath, tarnished to a yellow hue, may continue a
tolerable colour to the whole: so it is apparent that the removal
of the tarnish would be prejudicial, and make the
lace or embroidery less like gold than it was before.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE MAN COOK.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> man Cook, now become a requisite
member in the establishment of a man of
fashion, is in all respects the same as that of
a female Cook. He is generally a foreigner,
or if an Englishman, possesses a peculiar tact
in manufacturing many fashionable foreign
delicacies, or of introducing certain seasonings
and flavours in his dishes, which render them
more inviting to the palate of his employer,
than those produced by the simply healthful
modes of modern English Cooks.</p>

<p>The man Cook has the entire superintendance
of the kitchen, while his several female
assistants are employed in roasting, boiling,
and all the ordinary manual operations of the
kitchen. His attention is chiefly directed to
the stew-pan, in the manufacture of stews,
fricassees, fricandeaux, &amp;c. At the same time,
his situation is one of great labour and fatigue,
which, with the superior skill requisite for excellence
in his art, procures him a liberal salary,
frequently twice or thrice the sum given
to the most experienced female English Cook.</p>

<p>As the scientific preparations of the man
cook would themselves fill a large volume,
and are not generally useful in English families,
it is not deemed necessary to give place
to them in this work; but the following useful
receipts having, inadvertently, been omitted
under the head Cook, they are inserted in this
place rather than omitted altogether.</p>

<p>As the art of Cookery, or <i>gourmanderie</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[369]</span>
is reduced to a regular science in France,
where an egg may be cooked half a hundred
ways, so those who can afford large families
of servants, and give frequent entertainments,
consider a man-cook as economical,
because he produces an inexhaustible variety
without any waste of materials, and that elegance
and piquancy of flavours which are necessary
to stimulate the appetites of the luxurious.
In France, all culinary business is conducted
by men, and there are, at least, as
many men cooks as considerable kitchens;
but in England, men cooks are kept only in
about 3 or 400 great and wealthy families,
and in about 40 or 50 London hotels. But it
is usual in smaller establishments to engage a
man cook for a day or two before an entertainment.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">METHOD OF PREPARING AN EAST INDIA CURRY, WITH
THE ARTICLES USED THEREIN.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Let the fowl, duck, rabbit, meat, fish, or vegetable, &amp;c.
be cut up into small pieces, sprinkling a little flour thereon,
fried in butter, (with two middle-sized onions sliced fine,)
or what is called drawn in a pan, then stewed in the gravy
from a pound of beef (though water is as frequently used)
over a brisk fire, for about twenty minutes, with two or
three table-spoonsful of the mixture, as below, stirring the
whole occasionally; or the powder may be rubbed well over
the fowl, &amp;c. and fried with it, adding two ounces of butter,
the juice of a fine lemon, or half a wine glass of lemon
juice, or lemon pickle,—two cloves of garlic, chopped very
fine, and one tea-spoonful of salt. If any of the ingredients
predominate too much, or an insufficiency prevail,
subtract or add according to taste. For a larger quantify
of meat than the weight of a large fowl, use more of the
mixture in proportion. The curry will be much improved
by the mixture being made into a thin paste with a few
spoonsful of cream, and then rubbed over the meat, previously
to its being put into the stew-pan.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">[370]</span></p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">CURRY POWDER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Thirteen ounces coriander seed, three ounces cumin seed,
two ounces black pepper, four ounces China turmeric, or
curcuma root, half an ounce Cayenne pepper, one quarter
of an ounce powdered cassia, one quarter of an ounce powdered
white ginger, also one half of an ounce of cardamums,
one quarter of an ounce of cloves, and one quarter of an
ounce of allspice.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The above quantities are enough for twenty curries, but it
should be kept dry in a tin canister.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The curried fowl, &amp;c. as above, will require three quarters
of a pound of rice to be a sufficiency for curry eaters.
The curry and the rice should be served in separate dishes,
with covers, the dishes having heaters, or in hot water
dishes, such as those used for beef-steaks.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">N. B.—Two or three sour apples cut into quarters, as
well as a few fresh mushrooms, are great improvements to
all curries; as are truffles. If the latter are used, the liquor
in which they are boiled should be added to the curry.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">MODE OF PREPARING MULGA-TAWNEY, AS AT MADRAS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Cut up a fowl, duck, rabbit, beef, or mutton, boil the
same in two quarts of water for a quarter of an hour; then
mix the under-mentioned therein, previously bruising the
spices in a mortar, rejecting the husk. For a larger quantity
of meat than the weight of a large fowl, use more of the
mixture in proportion.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Two table spoons over-filled of the curry powder or ingredients,
answers the purpose, and better, adding the butter,
onions, garlic, pease-flour, acid, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">One quarter of an ounce China turmeric, one sixth of an
ounce Cayenne pepper, one ounce and a quarter coriander
seed, one third of an ounce of powdered cassia, two
drams two scruples black pepper.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">One table-spoon of butter; juice from a fine lemon, or
equal quantity of lemon-pickle, three middle sized onions
cut fine, six cloves of garlic chopped very fine, six tea-spoons
of pease-flour, high-dried or baked; then pour
thereon half a pint of boiling-water, strain the ingredients
through a fine cloth or sieve, then put the same with fowl,
&amp;c. over the fire, adding at this time the butter and onions
previously fried together, boil the same for half an hour,
adding, in the last five minutes, the acid, when the Mulga-tawney
will be ready for the table; which eaten as soup and
bouilli, mixing rice therein, will prove not only palatable,
but an excellent stomachic. The Mulga-tawney, or soup,
when done, should be nearly the consistency of cream; if
it should prove otherwise, when proceeding as above, more
or less water should be used on the onset, but not afterwards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[371]</span>
added. The soup with the meat to be served in a tureen,
and sent to table quite hot; the rice in a dish having hot
water below and a cover.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">A prejudice may exist against Curry and Mulga-tawney,
but there can be no doubt of both being perfectly wholesome;
as, to wit, throughout the East Indies, it is the daily
food of millions of all ages.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">METHOD OF BOILING RICE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The following is different from that adopted generally in
England, but was followed by an old Indian officer when
here, and found to answer perfectly well; but the object to
be accomplished is, that the rice should be well done, as
white as possible, and perfectly free from water: the rice
used should be Patna; the Carolina, though much whiter, is
not so good either for Curry or Mulga-tawney.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take a pound of Patna rice, have the same well washed,
looking over each grain for small stones, husks, &amp;c. then put
the rice into a saucepan, and pour thereon boiling water,
put on the cover, and let the saucepan remain off the fire
about a quarter of an hour; in that time, if the water was
full boiling, the rice will be sufficiently softened for use;
pour the water off, and to dry the rice, set it over the fire
for a couple of minutes, stirring it well during the time
with a fork. Proceeding as above the rice will be as dry
and as well cooked as that prepared by the natives in the
East Indies; great care to be taken that it does not become
hard by the heat.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Another way of boiling the rice is, to soak it an hour in
cold water, then put it into a saucepan and cover it with hot
water, adding one tea-spoonful of salt to every tea-cup full
of rice. Place it over the fire, and when it has boiled
about ten minutes, the water should be poured off. Then
cover the saucepan close down, and let it stand by the fire
for a few minutes, when the rice will become dry, and fit
to serve up with your curry.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE HEAD COACHMAN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the sobriety, steady conduct, and respectable
appearance of this important servant,
depend the exterior appearance of the family
with which he resides. Every genuine Coachman
has his characteristic costume. His
flaxen curls or wig, his low cocked hat, his
plush breeches, and his benjamin surtout,
his clothes being also well brushed, and the
lace and buttons in a state of high polish.
Care in driving his horses so as to preserve
his own family and not injure other passengers
on horse or foot, that he may not involve his
master in law-suits, and wound the feelings
of those he is driving, is of the utmost consequence.
It is his business to have the carriage
kept in repair, and to prevent his master being
imposed upon by wanton charges; and in
like manner to advise and assist in the purchase
of horses, and in this delicate business,
protect the interest of his employer. Much
depends on his zeal, as to the annual expenditure
of a carriage, with reference to the coach-maker,
the horse-dealer, and the farrier; and
he will do well always to make special contract,
and leave as little as possible to the conscience
of others. When only one coachman
is kept, his duties generally include the whole
of the stable business, as well as the cleaning,
greasing, and examining the carriage; about
which latter, he should never trust to chance;
and consult the smith or coach-maker as often
as he apprehends a possibility of danger. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[373]</span>
following instructions apply to the coachman’s
duty when assisted by an establishment, but
they apply to the coachman alone when there
is no stable establishment, and whether the
horses are jobbed or not, his anxious attention
to their welfare is equally required.</p>

<p>If not fatigued by late hours on the preceding
night, he rises to take care of his horses,
at the same hour as the other men on the establishment,
and they are attended in the
same manner, by himself and his assistants,
as is hereafter described, under the head <i>Groom</i>.</p>

<p>The necessary morning business of the stable
usually occupies the servants till breakfast
time, after which they all return to the stable,
shake down the litter on each side of the
horses, and put the stable in good order, in
expectation of their master, who probably,
pays them a visit after breakfast to inspect the
horses, give orders, or make enquiries.</p>

<p>The helpers and assistants are now busily
employed in looking over and cleaning such
of the harness as was last used, and remains
uncleaned. This, having been washed from
the wet dirt, and clean sponged over-night,
after the arrival of the carriage, and being
now dry, is first brushed with a dry hard
brush, and the brass ornaments cleaned, for
which purpose see the receipts; or the silver
ornaments may be cleaned with finely-powdered
charcoal, and polished off with a soft
brush.</p>

<p>The ornaments being cleaned, the leathers
are to be blacked with the liquid mixture,
which is a very valuable and excellent receipt
for that purpose; the brushes to be
used are, 1, a hard brush for taking off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[374]</span>
dirt; 2, a soft brush for laying on the mixture;
and 3, a polishing brush.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the coachmen, with their
assistants, or each, if more than one, proceed
to clean their respective coaches; first, well
washing the carriage part and wheels with a
mop and a water brush. The back straps and
straps of the springs are to be blacked, and in
short, all the parts, that are of leather, are to
be blacked in the same way as the harness,
the brass or other ornaments being first
cleaned. The wheels and bed of the carriage
are next to be greased or oiled, and the linch-pins
securely put in.</p>

<p>The inside of the coach is then to be brushed,
the glasses cleaned, and the lamps cleaned
and trimmed.</p>

<p>The carriage, horses, harness, and the whole
equipage being now ready, the coachman attends
his master or mistress for <i>orders</i>, if not
previously received.</p>

<p>When the time is nearly arrived at which
the coach is ordered, the helper or assistants
harness the horses and <i>put them to</i>, while
the coachman is dressing himself. He then
narrowly inspects the whole equipage—sees
that the coach, horses, harness, and all things
are in order; when taking his whip and the
reins in his left hand, a man standing at the
heads of the horses, he mounts the box, on
the <i>near side</i>, and drives off to the door.</p>

<p>In due time, the coach and other carriages,
as well as the saddle horses, return, when the
coachman alights, unbuckles the reins, and
giving the horses into the care of the helpers,
takes his whip with him into the stable, and
deposits it in its proper place. He then, if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[375]</span>
there be time and day-light, washes and cleans
his coach.</p>

<p>At eight o’clock, if not otherwise engaged,
he attends the regular stable duties, and waters,
feeds, rubs down, litters, and racks up
his horses, in the usual manner.</p>

<p>The wages of the head or upper coachman,
is from 25 to 36 guineas per annum, with generally
two suits of livery—a box coat once
in two or three years, two hats, and two pair
of boots; also one or two stable dresses, consisting
of overalls, jackets, waistcoats, and undress
frock coat.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN BRASS ORNAMENTS ON CARRIAGES AND
HARNESS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE FOOTMAN.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> business of the Footman is so multifarious
and incessant, that in most families, if he
be industrious, attentive, and disposed to
make himself useful, he will find full employment
in the affairs of the house, and the more
useful he can make himself, in a general way,
the more acceptable will be his services to the
whole house, the greater will be his reward,
and the more comfortable he will be himself.</p>

<p>In many genteel small families, the footman
is the only man servant, in which case he is
expected to make himself generally useful;
but his particular departments are, the cleaning
of the knives, shoes, plate, and furniture;
answering the door, going of errands, waiting
at table, and answering the parlour bell. The
footman finds himself merely in linen, stockings,
shoes, and washing; but if silk stockings, or
any extra articles are expected to be worn, they
are found by the family. On quitting service,
every livery servant is expected to leave behind
him any livery had within six months;
the last new livery is usually reserved for
Sundays and dress occasions.</p>

<p>For the better dispatch of his own particular
business, it is indispensably necessary that
the footman should <i>rise early</i>, and as every
moment of his time will be appropriated, he
must endeavour to get that part of his business,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[377]</span>
which depends upon himself, done before
the family are stirring, as interruptions
may then occur, and his necessary labours
be unavoidably delayed, or made to interfere
with other business, not less necessary.</p>

<p>The footman should endeavour to get the
dirtiest part of his work done first; such as
cleaning the shoes and boots, knives and forks,
brushing and cleaning clothes, hats and gloves,
and cleaning the furniture, &amp;c. &amp;c. For these
purposes, his working dress should be generally
a pair of overalls, a waistcoat and fustian
jacket, and a leather apron, with a white
apron to put on occasionally, when called from
these duties.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>The business of the footman below stairs being
done, he next proceeds to clean the lamps in the
best rooms. The oil in them should be fine
and good, and changed once a week or ten
days, and the cottons should be thick and
closely woven, always kept dry, and cut even
at the top, and soaked a little when fresh put
in, by letting down the oil to them for a short
time.</p>

<p>For cleaning boots and shoes, he takes
care to provide himself with proper brushes
and good blacking. In boots he will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[378]</span>
clean the tops till he has finished the feet and
legs, when it will be necessary to cover the
legs whilst he is cleaning the tops.</p>

<p>Ladies’ shoes are to be cleaned with milk,
and other liquids, according to their colour, and
merely the edges of the soles are to be blacked
and polished, but in cleaning these and gentlemen’s
dress shoes, great care must be
taken not to soil the inside linings.</p>

<p>Afterwards, the next business in rotation in
the morning, will be to clean the mahogany
and other furniture, in the parlour and best
rooms. Whether the tables, side-boards, cellerets,
chairs, &amp;c. be of a light or dark colour,
they must be cleaned with a preparation or oil
of an appropriate colour.</p>

<p>In using the different compositions, have
two pieces of woollen cloth for each, one
to put it on with, and the other for polishing.
Sometimes a hard brush will be required
to lay on the paste, and a piece of soft
cork to rub out the stains. Always rub the
wood the way of the grain, and remember to
dust the furniture before you begin to clean it.</p>

<p>If oil be used, let it be rubbed off as quickly
as possible, and then polished with another
cloth. When wax is used, let it be applied
very sparingly, and polished off with another
cloth.</p>

<p>The brass rods or other ornaments to side-boards,
cellarets, &amp;c. should be cleaned before
the mahogany is touched. The dirt on these
ornaments may be removed with flannel well
soaped, and polished off with the plate leather.
If any brass work has the lacquer worn

leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[379]</span></p>

<p>Every article of furniture should be cleaned
and rubbed in the middle of the room, when
convenient, to prevent smearing and injuring
the walls.</p>

<p><i>Looking Glasses</i> being very costly, should be
cleaned with great care. First, take a clean
soft sponge, just squeezed out of water, and
then dipped in spirits of wine; rub the glass
over with this, and then polish it off with fine
powder blue, or whiting tied up in muslin,
quickly laid on, and then well rubbed off, with
a clean cloth, and afterwards with a silk handkerchief.
If the glass be very large, no more
of it should be wetted with the spirit at a
time, than can be cleaned off quickly.</p>

<p>The frames must never be touched with any
thing wet or damp. Cotton-wool is the best
thing to rub them with, as it will take off the
stains and dirt without doing any injury;<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> or,
if the frames are varnished, they may be rubbed
with the spirits of wine, which will at
once take out the spots and dirt, after which
they may be re-varnished.</p>

<p>Pictures are best cleaned lightly with a wet
sponge, but should never be touched with a
cloth.</p>

<p>The attendance of the footman will now be
required in the breakfast parlour, for which
purpose, he must prepare by washing himself,
and throwing off his working dress.</p>

<p>In the directions to the butler, we have
given sufficiently at large, setting out the
breakfast table, and waiting at breakfast,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[380]</span>
which in small families becomes solely the
business of the footman.</p>

<p>After breakfast, he sets the parlour to rights
by sweeping up the crumbs, shaking the green
cloth, and laying it again on the table, making
up the fire and sweeping up the hearth.</p>

<p>The footman now carries out such messages
and cards as he is charged to deliver.</p>

<p>When the footman is obliged to go out with
the carriage, the butler or under butler usually
undertakes to do such things in his absence,
as he necessarily leaves undone.</p>

<p>In large families, the footman lays the cloth
for dinner, and the knives and forks and
glasses, and the butler arranges the silver articles,
and sees that the whole is correctly laid
out. When the hour of dinner approaches,
notice is usually given, by the ringing of a
bell by the footman, ten or fifteen minutes
before the time; and during this time he is
busy in carrying up every thing that he thinks
may or can be wanted during dinner, so as to
have every thing at hand, at that time. Again
he rings the dinner bell, to announce to the
family that dinner is going up, when the butler
takes the first dish, and is followed by the
under butler and footman with the remainder
of the fish and soups, which the butler places
on the table, and removing the covers, gives
them to the footman and under butler, who
convey them out of the room. The servants
then take their respective stations,—the butler
at the side-board, to serve the wines or beer
when called for; the footman at the back of
his master’s chair, and the lady’s footman, if
any, behind his lady. When the soups and
fish have been served round, the butler rings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[381]</span>
the dining-room bell to warn the cook to be
ready with the removes, which are generally,
solid joints of meat, or the first course, if no
removes; the butler then removes the dishes
from the table, and hands them to the footman
or under butler, who carries them away.
If wine or beer is asked for, the footman or
under butler puts the empty glasses on a waiter,
and the butler fills them. When a clean
plate is wanted, the butler hands it to the
footman, with a clean knife and fork, and the
footman puts the dirty one in the proper place
to be taken away.</p>

<p>When the butler sees that the first course is
nearly done with, he again gives notice to the
cook, and proceeds to take all the dishes off
the table, and the footman and under butler
take them away, and fetch the second
course. The butler being employed, in the
mean time, in setting the table in order, laying
the mats, clean spoons, glasses, &amp;c. The
footman, with the assistance of the house-maids
and others, having brought up the next
course, the butler places the dishes on the
table, takes off the covers, hands them to the
footman, to be taken away, and again takes
his station at the side-board, and during the
whole dinner, the same kind of etiquette as
before, is observed by every servant in attendance,
(of which, in some cases, there are several
besides the butler, under butler, and footman;
namely, the lady’s footman, valet, and
on particular occasions, waiters hired for the
purpose.) The third course, (consisting of
pastry, viz. pies, tarts, &amp;c. with game at the
top and bottom of the table, and the cheese
and salads placed on the side-board) which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[382]</span>
being removed, as before, the butler with
a napkin wipes off the stains and marks of
the hot dishes on the tables, and places the
dessert, as it is brought up by the footman and
under butler. He also puts the wine on the
table, and the under butler the wine-glasses,
while the footman places the finger glasses
before each person, and a plate, with a
knife and fork and spoon on each plate, the
butler putting other spoons for serving the
fruits, jellies, &amp;c. The butler takes his place
behind his master’s chair, at the foot of the
table, and the lady’s footman, behind his lady’s
chair at the head, to hand the wines, &amp;c. and
all the other servants leave the room, taking
with them all the things that have been used.</p>

<p>The footman, as soon as all the things are
carried down, repairs to the drawing-room,
makes up the fire, sweeps up the hearth, and
otherwise prepares that room. The butler also
taking occasion to see that the lamps and candles
are lighted, and the card tables set out,
with candles and two packs of cards on each,
and the chairs and sofas properly arranged by
the footman.</p>

<p>The butler and footman then retire to their
several avocations in the butler’s pantry, where
the footman is employed in washing and
wiping the glasses, and the under butler cleaning
the plate, (which the kitchen maid generally
washes.) When the ladies have retired
from the dining-room, and the drawing-room
bell rings for coffee, the footman enters with
the tray, the coffee being made below stairs,
and the bread and butter, cakes, toast, &amp;c. the
under butler, or some other servant following,
to take away the empty cups and saucers on a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[383]</span>
waiter or tray. At tea time, the butler carries
up the tea-tray, and the footman the
toast, muffins, &amp;c. (which are prepared by the
kitchen maid). Tea is announced to the gentlemen
by the footman, and the gentlemen
having joined the ladies, the tea and coffee is
handed round by the butler, bread and butter,
toast, &amp;c. by the footman, the under butler following
to take away the cups and saucers.</p>

<p>If there be no supper, the wine, when ordered,
is carried in by the butler, and the
glasses, &amp;c. on a tray, by the footman; if sandwiches
are introduced, they are carried up on
a tray, covered with a clean cloth, by the
footman, the butler attending in the room to
hand the wines, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The company being gone, the bed-room
candlesticks are brought by the footman, and
are handed to each person respectively as
he wishes to retire to bed.</p>

<p>The footman then shuts up all the lower part
of the house, if not before done, and retires
to bed himself. The butler follows last, sees
all safe, and retires also.</p>

<p>In going out with the carriage, the footman
should be dressed in his best livery, his shoes
and stockings being very clean, and his hat,
great coat, &amp;c. being well brushed; nothing
being so disgraceful as a slovenly exterior.
He should be ready at receiving directions
at the carriage door, and accurate in delivering
them to the coachman, and though he may
indicate the importance of his family by his
style of knocking at a door, he ought to have
some regard to the nerves of the family and
the peace of the neighbourhood. When the
carriage waits at routs or public places, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">[384]</span>
should abstain from drinking with other servants,
and take care to be within call when
wanted. His expertness in letting down the
steps and putting them up again, and his caution
in shutting the door, so as not to injure
any one, or the dresses of the ladies, are expected.</p>

<p>When he walks out behind his mistress, he
should preserve a modest demeanour, and protect
her, if necessary, from intrusion or insult;
and on this duty he is expected to be particularly
attentive to every part of his dress. In
answering the door it is his duty to behave
respectfully to all enquirers after his master
or mistress, and never to presume on his knowledge
of persons whom they ought to see or
ought not to see, except in obedience to positive
instructions.</p>

<p>The Footman’s wages are from 20 to 30
guineas, with two suits of livery, and two undress
suits.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">LIQUID FOR CLEANSING BOOT TOPS, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN MAHOGANY FURNITURE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take two ounces of bees’ wax, scrape it fine, put it into
a pot or jar, and pour over it enough of spirits of turpentine
to cover it; let it stand a little while, and it will be
ready for use. If the furniture is to be kept a dark colour,
mix a very small quantity of alkanet root or rose-pink, with it.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN FURNITURE WITH OIL.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Take a pint of cold-drawn linseed oil, and if you wish to
colour it, take a little alkanet root or rose-pink, and mix
with it: put a little on the furniture, and rub it well with a
woollen cloth; do not let the oil stand long on the table
before it is rubbed off.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">GERMAN POLISH FOR FURNITURE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Melt a quarter of a pound of yellow wax and an ounce of
black resin, well beaten, in an earthen pipkin. Then pour
in by degrees two ounces of spirit of turpentine. When the
whole is thoroughly mixed, put it into an earthen jar, and
keep it covered for use. Spread a little of it on the furniture
with a woollen cloth, rub it well in, and in a few days
the polish will be as hard and as bright as varnish.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO WARM A CARRIAGE.</p>

</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO PRESERVE BRASS ORNAMENTS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Brass ornaments, when not gilt or lackered, may be cleaned,
and a fine colour may be given to them by two simple
processes. The first is to beat sal ammoniac into a fine
powder, then to moisten it with soft water, rubbing it on the
ornaments, which must be heated over charcoal, and rubbed
dry with bran and whiting. The second is to wash the
brass work with roche alum boiled in strong ley, in the proportion
of an ounce to a pint; when dry it must be rubbed
with fine tripoli. Either of these processes will give to brass
the brilliancy of gold.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO PREVENT THE SMOKING OF A LAMP.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Soak the wick in strong vinegar, and dry it well before
you use it; it will then burn both sweet and pleasant, and
give much satisfaction for the trifling trouble in preparing it.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">If for want of the above mentioned preparation any
should escape, a wet sponge suspended by a string or wire
over the flame of a lamp, at a few inches distance, will absorb
all the smoke and disagreeable effluvia. Rinse it in
warm water when wanted the next day.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN WATER CASKS.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[386]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Scour the inside well out with water and sand, and afterwards
apply a quantity of charcoal dust. Another and better
method is, to rinse them with a pretty strong solution of
oil of vitriol and water, which will entirely deprive them of
their foulness.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO TAKE STAINS OUT OF MAHOGANY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Mix 6 ounces of spirit of salts, and ½ an ounce of rock
salt of lemons (powdered) together. Drop a little on the
stains, and rub it with a cork till it disappear. Wash off
with cold water.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO REMOVE SPOTS OF GREASE FROM CLOTH.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Spots of grease may be removed by a diluted solution of
potash, but this must be cautiously applied, to prevent injury
to the cloth. Stains of white wax, which sometimes
fall upon clothes from wax-candles, are removed by spirits
of turpentine, or sulphuric ether. The marks of white paint
may also be discharged by the above-mentioned agents.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN CANDLESTICKS AND SNUFFERS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">If silver or plated, care must be taken that they are not
scratched in getting off the wax or grease; therefore never
use a knife for that purpose, nor hold them before the fire to
melt the wax or grease, as in general the hollow part of the
candlesticks, towards the bottom, is filled with a composition
that will melt if made too hot. Pour boiling water over
them; this will take all the grease off without injury, if
wiped directly with an old cloth, and save the brushes from
being greased: let them in all other respects be cleaned like
the rest of the plate.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN JAPANNED CANDLESTICKS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Never hold them near the fire, nor scrape them with a
knife; the best way is to pour water upon them just hot
enough to melt the grease; then wipe them with a cloth, and
if they look smeared, sprinkle a little whiting or flour upon
them, and rub it clean off.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Be very particular in cleaning the patent snuffers, as they
go with a spring, and are easily broken. The part which
shuts up the snuffings has in general a small hole in it, where
a pin can be put in to keep it open while cleaning it; be
sure to have them well cleaned, that the snuff may not drop
about when using them. The extinguishers likewise must be
cleaned in the inside, and put ready with the snuffers, that
the candlesticks may not be taken up without them.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN FURNITURE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Keep the furniture paste or oil in a proper can or jar, that
there may be no danger of upsetting when using it. Have two
pieces of woollen cloth, one for rubbing it on, the other for
rubbing it dry and polishing; also an old linen cloth to finish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[387]</span>
with, and a piece of smooth soft cork to rub out the stains:
use a brush if the paste be hard. Always dust the table well
before the oil or paste is put on; and if it should be stained
rub it with a damp sponge, and then with a dry cloth. If
the stain does not disappear, rub it well with the cork, or a
brush the way of the grain, for if rubbed cross-grained, it will
be sure to scratch it. Be careful to keep the cork and
brush free from dust and dirt. When the dust is cleaned
off and the stains have been got out, put on the oil or paste,
but not too much at a time; rub it well into the wood; if oil,
be as quick as possible in rubbing it over the table, and then
polish it with another woollen cloth. If wax, put a little
bit on the woollen cloth, with the finger, or a small stick;
rub it well with this till the table has a high polish, then have
another cloth to finish it with. Be very careful to have the
edges of the tables well cleaned, and the oil and wax well
rubbed off.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO BRUSH CLOTHES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Have a wooden horse to put the clothes on, and a small
cane or small hand-whip to beat the dust out of them; also
a board or table long enough for them to be put their whole
length when brushing them. Have two brushes, one hard
and the other soft: use the hardest for the great coats, and
the others when spotted with dirt. Fine cloth coats should
never be brushed with too hard a brush, as this will take off
the nap, and make them look bare in a little time. Be careful
in the choice of your cane; do not have it too large, and
be particular not to hit too hard; be careful also not to hit
the buttons, for it will scratch, if not break them.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">If a coat be wet, and spotted with dirt, let it be quite dry
before you brush it; then rub out the spots with the hands,
taking care not to rumple it. If it want beating, do it as before
directed; then lay the coat at its full length on a board;
let the collar be towards the left hand, and the brush in the
right; brush the back of the collar first, between the two
shoulders next, and then the sleeves, &amp;c. observing to brush
the cloth the same way that the nap goes, which is towards
the bottom of the coat. When both sides are properly done,
fold them together; then brush the inside, and last of all the
collar.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO TAKE OUT GREASE FROM CLOTHES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Have a hot iron with some thick brown paper: lay the
paper on the part where the grease is, then put the iron upon
the spot; if the grease comes through the paper, put on another
piece, till it does not soil the paper. If not all out, wrap
a little bit of cloth or flannel round the finger, dip it into spirit
of wine, and rub the grease spot; this will take it entirely
out. Be careful not to have the iron too hot; but try it
on a piece of white paper, and if it turn the paper brown, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[388]</span>
scorch in the least, it is too hot. If paint should get on the
coats, always have spirit of wine or turpentine ready, which,
with a piece of flannel or cloth, will easily take it off, if not
left to get quite dry.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN TEA TRAYS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Do not pour boiling water over them, particularly on japanned
ones, as it will make the varnish crack and peel off;
but have a sponge wetted with warm water and a little soap,
if the tray be very dirty, then rub it with a cloth; if it
looks smeary, dust on a little flour, then rub it with a dry
cloth. If the paper tray gets marked, take a piece of woollen
cloth, with a little sweet oil, and rub it over the marks;
if any thing will take them out this will. Let the urn be
emptied, and the top wiped dry, particularly the outside,
for if any wet be suffered to dry on, it will leave a mark.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">METHOD OF DARKENING MAHOGANY.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Nothing more is necessary than to wash the mahogany
with lime-water, which may be readily made by dropping a
nodule of lime into a bason of water.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO WASH AND CLEAN GENTLEMEN’S GLOVES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Wash them in soap and water till the dirt is got out, then
stretch them on wooden hands, or pull them out in their proper
shape. Never wring them as that puts them out of form
and makes them shrink; put them one upon another and
press the water out. Then rub the following mixture over
the outside of the gloves. If wanted quite yellow, take
yellow ochre; if quite white, pipe clay; if between the
two, mix a little of each together. By proper mixture
of these any shade may be produced. Mix the colour with
beer or vinegar.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Let them dry gradually, not too near the fire nor in too
hot a sun; when they are about half dried rub them well,
and stretch them out to keep them from shrinking and to
soften them. When they are well rubbed and dried take a
small cane and beat them, then brush them; when this is
done iron them rather warm, with a piece of paper over
them, but do not let the iron be too hot.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO MANAGE WATER-PIPES IN WINTER.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">When the frost begins to set in, cover the water-pipes
with hay or straw bands, twisted tight round them. Let
the cisterns and water butts be washed out occasionally;
this will keep the water pure and fresh.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In pumping up water into the cistern for the water-closet,
be very particular, in winter-time, as in general the pipes go
up the outside of the house. Let all the water be let out of
the pipe when you have done pumping; but if this be forgotten,
and it should get frozen, take a small gimblet and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">[389]</span>
bore a <i>hole</i> in the pipe, a little distance from the place where
it is let off, which will prevent its bursting. Put a peg in
to the hole when the water is let off. Pump the water up
into the cistern, for the closet every morning, and once a
week take a pail of water, and cast it into the basin, having
first opened the trap at the bottom; this will clear the soil
out of the pipe.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO PRESERVE HATS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Hats require great care, or they will soon look shabby.
Brush them with a soft camel-hair brush, which will keep
the fur smooth. Have a stick for each hat, to keep it in its
proper shape, especially if the hat be wet: put the stick in
as soon as the hat is taken off, and when dry put it into a
hat-box, particularly if not in constant use, as the air and
dust soon turn hats brown. If the hat is very wet, handle
it as lightly as possible; wipe it dry with a cloth or silk
handkerchief; then brush it with the soft brush.</p>

turpentine is soon dissipated; but the wax, which by its
mixture is reduced to a state of very great division, may be
extended with more ease, and in a more uniform manner.
The essence soon penetrates the pores of the wood, calls
forth the colour of it, causes the wax to adhere better, and
the lustre which thence results is equal to that of varnish,

white wine vinegar, 4 pints.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Mix.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This blacking, (recommended by Mr. Gray,
lecturer on the materia medica,) is superior in giving leather
a finer polish than any of those that are advertised, as they
all contain sulphuric acid, (oil of vitriol,) which is necessary,
to give it the polishing quality, but it renders leather rotten
and very liable to crack.</p>

vitriolic acid, and spermaceti, (or common oil,)<br>
each 1½&#160;oz.</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Mix the acid and oil first, afterwards add the other ingredients;
if, when it is used, it does not dry quick enough on
the leather, add a little more of the vitriol, a little at a
time. When there is too much of the vitriolic acid, which
is various in its strength, the mixture will give it a brown
colour.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO REMOVE UNPLEASANT ODOURS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">The unpleasant smell of new paint is best removed by
time, and atmospheric ventilation: but tubs of water placed
in the apartment will act more rapidly; with this inconvenience,
however, that the gloss of the paint will be destroyed.
Unpleasant smells from water-closets, or all articles of
furniture connected with them, may be modified by the application
of quick-lime, to which may be added the soap-suds
that have been used in washing, which neutralize the
pungently offensive salts. A little quick-lime put into a
night-chair will destroy all disagreeable effluvia.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Aromatic pastiles of the following composition may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[393]</span>
burned with great success: take of camphor, flowers of benzoin,
powdered charcoal, powdered cascarilla bark, powdered
Turkey myrrh, and powdered nitre, each equal quantities;
beat them with syrup sufficient to form a mass, and
divide into pastiles of conical shape. They may be mixed
up with spirit of turpentine, or any thing inflammable.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN KNIVES AND FORKS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Procure a smooth board, free from knots, or one covered
with leather. If the latter, melt a sufficient quantity of
mutton suet, and put it hot upon the leather with a piece of
flannel; then take two pieces of soft Flanders brick, and
rub them one against the other over the leather till it is covered
with the powder, which rub in until no grease comes
through, when a knife is passed over the leather, which may
easily be known by the knife keeping its polish.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">If only a plain board, rub the brick two or three times
over it; for if too much be put on at once it will make the
blades of the knives look rough and scratched. Let the
board be of a proper height, and set so that you may be in a
sloping position while cleaning the knives. Take a knife
in each hand, holding them back to back; stand opposite
the middle of the board; lay the knives flat upon it, and do
not bear too hard upon them; by this method it will be easier
to clean two knives at a time than one, and they will be
less liable to be snapped or broken, when pressed on too
heavily.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Be careful to keep a good edge on the knives. Carving
knives in particular ought to be kept sharp, which may easily
be done by taking one in each hand, back to back when
cleaning, scarcely letting them touch the board when expanding
the arms, but when drawing the hands together
again, bearing a little hard on the edge of the knives; this
will give them not only a good edge and a fine polish, but is
much better than sharpening them with a steel.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">The best way to clean steel forks is to fill a small oyster
barrel with fine gravel, brick dust, or sand, mixed with a
little hay or moss: make it moderately damp, press it well
down, and let it always be kept damp. By running the
prongs of the forks a few times into this, all the stains on
them will be removed. Then have a small stick, shaped like
a knife, with leather round it to polish between the prongs,
&amp;c. having first carefully brushed off the dust from them as
soon as they are taken out of the tub. A knife board is often
spoiled by cleaning forks, and the backs of the knives,
upon it; to prevent this, fasten a piece of old hat or leather on
the board where the forks and backs of knives are to be
cleaned.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Always turn the back of the knives towards the palm of
the hand in wiping them, which will prevent all danger from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[394]</span>
cutting. In wiping the forks put the corner of the cloth between
the prongs, to remove any dirt or dust that may not
have been thoroughly brushed out; and if there be silver
ferules on the knives and forks, or silver handles, they must
be rubbed with a piece of leather and plate powder, keeping
the blades covered while the handles are cleaning.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Wipe the knives and folks as soon as possible after being
used, as the longer they are left with grease and stains on
them the harder they will be to clean; particularly if they
have been used for acids, salads, tarts, &amp;c. Have then a jug
of hot water ready to put them into as soon as done with,
and wipe them as before directed.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In order to keep knives and forks in good condition when
they are not in use, rub the steel part with a flannel dipped in
oil; wipe the oil off after a few hours, as there is often water
in it; or dust the blades and prongs with quick-lime, finely
powdered, and kept in a muslin bag.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO CLEAN PLATED ARTICLES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Plated articles require even more care than silver ones;
they should be cleaned with soft brushes, not too often, and
never with any thing but plate powder, not even whiting by
itself; do not wet them more than can be helped or they will
tarnish; nor brush them more than is necessary, or the silver
will come off; the best thing for them is spirit of wine or
oil, and take care that no plated articles remain long dirty or
damp, for if they do they will rust, in case they are plated
on steel, and canker if plated on copper.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Wash the brushes after the plate is cleaned with warm
water and soap, and then set them to dry, with the wooden

the Butler in cleaning his master’s clothes

to the situation of Butler, and as even in
his present station he will have occasion for
more particular directions, he will do well
frequently to refer to the hints to the Butler,
where he will find the immediate duties of the

drain it over the saucepan, dry it before the fire, and rub it
bright with leather. Then put more into the pan in the same
manner until it is all boiled. Put clean linen rags into the
pan to soak up the remainder, and when dry, they will give
a beautiful polish to the plate merely by rubbing it with
them. They are likewise admirable for cleaning brass locks,

summer, and six in the winter.</p>

<p>When the Groom has two or more horses
under his care, with a chaise, or other vehicle
or vehicles, he is generally allowed a boy to
assist him in the stable.</p>

<p>We shall here insert the <i>general care and
management of horses</i>, because in every stable
establishment, however <i>small</i>, or however
<i>large</i>, a Groom is to be found; and he ought
to be fully competent to this branch of stable
experience. In order to avoid repetition, we
shall refer every other servant in this department,
to this description of the usual care and
management of horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[400]</span></p>

<p>The first thing, on entering the stable, is to
give to each horse about a gallon of clean water
in a clean bucket; then to shake up the
best litter, under the manger, sweep out each
stall, and clean out the whole stable. Every
Coachman and Groom feeds his own horses;<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
and during the time of their feeding, he proceeds
to <i>dress</i> them: thus each horse is first
curried all over, with the curry-comb, to
loosen the dirt and dust on its skin; then
brushed with a whalebone brush, to take the
dust off; next whisped with straw, to smooth
and cleanse its coat; and again brushed with
the brush and curry-comb, to take off what
dust may remain; after which the horse is
whisped again with a damp lock of hay, and
finally, rubbed down with a woollen rubber,
or a clean cloth. The horse is then turned
round in the stall, and his head is next brushed
well and whisped clean and smooth, with a
damp lock of hay. After this, his ears are
drawn through the hands, for several minutes,
till made warm, and then the insides of the
ears are wiped out with a damp sponge, to remove
such dust and filth as may have accumulated
there. The sponge after being washed
clean, is then applied to the eyes, to cleanse
them from dust, and any exudation that may
have arisen in them. The nostrils are also
sponged clean, and the whole head is afterwards
finished by rubbing it with a cloth, in
the same manner as the body had previously
been cleaned. The horse is then turned round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[401]</span>
into its proper situation, the head stall put on,
and the dirt and filth that may have accumulated
under its tail, are then washed away with
a sponge. The mane and tail are next cleaned
and laid with a mane comb and water brush,
used alternately with both hands; the head
and body are again wiped over, and the body
clothes are put on and fastened with a surcingle.</p>

<p>The Groom next examines the horse’s heels,
picks out the dirt from the feet, and washes
its heels, with a water brush and plenty of
water. If any horse has bad feet, they are
then to be dressed and stuffed. Lastly, a due
portion of hay,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> (about three or four pounds)
is shaken into the rack, and then the horse is
considered as completely dressed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[402]</span></p>
<p>This is a summary of the whole process of
cleaning and dressing horses of every description.</p>

<p>Horses thus attended to, and regularly managed,
under the humane superintendance of a
diligent and conscientious Groom or Coachman,
will have healthy and beautiful appearance,
and in a great measure escape from
many diseases to which they would otherwise
be liable.</p>

<p>When the master rides out before breakfast,
the Groom rises so much the earlier, so as
to be able to get the horses for himself and
master ready, and at the time appointed. In
this case, he gives the horses not more than
two quarts of water each, and about half their
usual feed of corn. On their return from the
morning ride, the Groom sponges the eyes and
nostrils of the horses, and under their tails;
picks out their feet, washes their feet and
heels, and then otherwise cleans and dresses
them in the usual way, as already described.
When thus far dressed, it is necessary to hand-rub
their legs, downwards, for about ten minutes,
to prevent wind-galls, and to strengthen
the back sinews.</p>

<p>When horses have been ridden hard, or
have been a long journey, bandages must be
wrapped round their legs, (from the knee to
the fetlock joint) to prevent their swelling.</p>

<p>If their feet are heated, they must be stopped
with the following mixture, called stopping:
viz.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mix equal quantities of cow-dung, clay, tar, and kitchen
grease with urine, to the consistency of a stiff paste. This
is usually kept in a small tub, or box, with a handle, to be
ready when wanted.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[403]</span></p>

<p>The horses are then watered, fed, and littered
down.</p>

<p>All horses when they come in, if they have
sweated, or are very hot, must have their feet
and legs first washed, and then be walked
about ten or fifteen minutes, in the open air,
till they are properly cool and dry; when
they are to be well rubbed, and afterwards
cleaned in the usual way. They should be encouraged
to stale as soon as may be, by shaking
a little straw under them, and whistling to
them.</p>

<p>The saddles and bridles, with the bits and
stirrups, are to be wiped when they are taken
off, and are so left till the first opportunity,
when they are to be thoroughly cleaned and
put away.</p>

<p>If a gig, chaise, or other carriage has been
used in the morning, it will require to be
cleaned and got ready as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Such horses as are at home at twelve o’clock,
are, at that hour, to be watered and fed again,
and just wiped over, but not thoroughly
cleaned, as in the morning; their manes and
tails are, however, to be combed and properly
<i>laid</i> with the mane-comb and water brush.</p>

<p>When the Groom’s horses and carriages
come in, in the evening, he attends to his
horses first, washes their feet and legs and rubs
them quite dry, before he cleans them. He
afterwards cleans his gig, or whatever it may
be by day-light, if there be time, or at any
rate, he has to get his harness cleaned. About
eight o’clock the stable man repairs to the
stable, for the last time, cleans it out, waters,
feeds, and rubs down the horses, litters them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">[404]</span>
up, bandages their legs, stops their feet, (if necessary)
and racks them up for the night.</p>

<p>Wages 22<i>l.</i> to 25<i>l.</i> with, generally, two livery
suits, and two stable dresses a year.</p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO MAKE OATS PROVE DOUBLY NUTRITIOUS TO HORSES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Instead of grinding the oats, break them in a mill; and
the same quantity will prove doubly nutritious. Another
method is, to boil the corn, and give the horses the liquor in
which it has been boiled; the result will be, that instead of
six bushels in a crude state, three bushels, so prepared, will
be found to answer, and to keep the animals in superior vigour
and condition.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">SORES AND BRUISES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Over the whole sore, or where the part is bruised, or
where there is a tendency to suppuration, a poultice should
be applied and kept on by suitable bandages. The poultice
may be made of any kind of meal, fine bran, bruised linseed,
or of mashed turnips, carrots, &amp;c. The following has
been found useful as a common poultice: Fine bran, 1
quart; pour on it a sufficient quantity of boiling water to
make a thin paste; to this add of linseed powder enough
to give it a proper consistence. The poultice may be kept
on for a week or ten days, or even longer, if necessary,
changing it once or twice a day; and cleaning the wound,
when the poultice is removed, by washing it by means of a
soft rag or linen cloth, with water not more than blood
warm, (some sponge is too rough for this purpose); or,
where the wound is deep, the water may be injected into it
by a syringe, in order to clean it from the bottom.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Ointment.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">In the course of a few days, when the wound, by care
and proper management with the poultices, begins to put
on a healthy appearance, and seems to be clean and of
a reddish colour, not black or bloody; then there may be
applied an ointment made of tallow, linseed oil, bees’ wax,
and hog’s lard, in such proportion as to make it of a consistence
somewhat firmer than butter. The ointment should
be spread on some soft clean tow, and when applied to the
sore, it ought never to be tied hard upon it, (which is done
too frequently and very improperly,) but only fixed by a
bandage of proper length and breadth, (for a mere cord is
often improper,) so close and securely as to keep it from
slipping off. This application may be changed once a day;
or when nearly well, and discharging but little, once in two
days.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[405]</span></p>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Treatment according to the appearance of the part.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">When the wounded part begins to discharge a whitish,
thick matter, and is observed to fill up, the general treatment
and dressings to the sore, now mentioned, should be
continued; and in the course of the cure, the animal, when
free of fever, may be allowed better provision, and may take
gentle exercise. If the animal be feeble, from the loss of
blood originally, or from the long continuance of a feverish
state produced by the inflammation attending the wound, or
from weakness arising from confinement, or connected with
its constitution naturally; and if the wound appear to be
in a stationary state, very pale and flabby on its edges, with
a thin discharge, then better food may be given to it; and
if still no change should be observed, with the better
food, the wound may be treated somewhat differently from
what has been already advised. The ointment may be made
more stimulant, by adding to it some resin and less bees’
wax, or what would be still more stimulant, some common
turpentine; for it is only in very rare cases that oil of turpentine
can be requisite. The effects of an alteration in
the mode of treatment should be particularly remarked, and
stimulants should be laid aside, continued or increased, according
as may be judged proper. Before changing the
dressings applied to the wound, or before rendering them
more stimulant and active by using heating applications,
the effect of closer bandaging may be tried; for sometimes
by keeping the parts a little more firmly together, the cure
is promoted.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Food and Regimen.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">In the case of severe wounds, attention should be paid to
the condition of the animal in other respects. There being
always when such happen, a tendency to violent inflammation
and fever, that may end fatally, means should be
employed to moderate both. The apartment should be cool
and airy, and so quiet that the animal should not be disturbed;
the drink should not be warm, but rather cold, and
given freely, though not in too large quantities at a time;
the food should be sparingly given and of a poorer quality
than usual, and should be rather succulent and laxative,
than dry or apt to produce costiveness; bleeding may be
employed either generally from a vein, or, in some cases,
when it can be done, by cupping from the injured part, as in
the case of a bruise (though this last will be seldom requisite
or found convenient,) and it may be done more than
once or twice, as may seem proper; laxative medicines also
ought to be given and repeated, as there may be occasion.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">BLEEDING IN GENERAL.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[406]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Bleeding is often the most useful and efficacious means of
curing diseases in horses, &amp;c. In inflammatory affections,
it is generally the first remedy resorted to, and its immediate
salutary effects are often surprising.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">When it is necessary to lessen the whole quantity of
blood in the system, open the jugular or neck vein. If the
inflammation is local, bleed where it can be conveniently
done, either from the part affected, or in its vicinity, as by
opening the plate vein, superficial vein of the thigh, or temporal
arteries.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In fevers of all kinds, and when inflammation attacks any
important organ, as the brain, eyes, lungs, stomach, intestines,
liver, kidneys, bladder, &amp;c. bleeding is of the greatest
use. It diminishes the quantity of blood in the body; and
by this means prevents the ill effects of inflammation. The
quantity of blood to be taken varies according to the age,
size, condition, and constitution of the horse, and urgency
of the symptoms.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">From a large or strong horse, four or six quarts will be
requisite, and may be repeated in smaller quantities if symptoms
demand it. The blood, in these diseases, must flow
from a large orifice made in the vein. A horse should <i>never
be suffered to bleed upon the ground, but into a measure</i>, in order
that the proper quantity may be taken. Young horses, also,
while shedding their teeth, have sometimes much constitutional
irritation, which bleeding relieves. But in these affections
it is very rarely necessary to bleed to the same extent
as in fevers, &#038;c.; two or three quarts generally suffice
to be taken away.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Fulness of Blood.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Moderate bleeding, from two to three or four quarts, is
also used to remove fulness of habit, or plethora, attended
with slight inflammatory symptoms. In this case the eyes
appear heavy, dull, red or inflamed, frequently closed as if
asleep; the pulse small and oppressed; the heat of the body
somewhat increased; the legs swell; and the hairs rub off.
Horses that are removed from grass to a warm stable, and
full fed on hay and corn, and not sufficiently exercised, are
very subject to one or more of these symptoms. Regulating
the quantity of food given to him, proper exercise and occasional
laxatives, as the following powder, will be commonly
found sufficient after the first bleeding, and operation of an
aloetic purge. In slight affections of this kind, a brisk
purge will often alone be sufficient.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Laxative and Diaphoretic Powder.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-top-hanging">Take of crocus of antimony, finely levigated,<br>
nitre, cream of tartar, and flour of sulphur, of
each, 4 ounces:<br>
</p>

<p class="takeof-bottom-nohanging">Powder and mix them well together for use.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">[407]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">One table-spoonful of this mixture may be given every
night and morning, in a mash of scalded bran, or a feed of
corn moistened with water, that the powders may adhere
thereto.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">This powder will be found excellent for such horses as are
kept on dry meat, whether they be in the stable, or travel
on the road; also for stallions in the spring of the year, as
they not only keep the body cool and open, but cause them
to cast their coat, and make the skin appear as bright as silk.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">PURGING.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">In obstinate grease and swellings of the legs, accompanied
with lameness of the joints, dry coughs, worms, diseases
of the skin, farcy, apoplexy or staggers, affections of
the liver, &amp;c. &amp;c., mercurial purges are of the greatest service.
They purge; destroy worms; generally increase the
flow of urine; operate upon the skin, liver, and other viscera
in a peculiar manner; cause a healthful action in
these parts; and remove many chronic complaints incident
to the horse. Great caution is necessary during their operation,
lest the horse take cold. The water given him must
be warm, and when exercised he should be properly clothed.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Horses that are kept on dry meat, and are full fed, with
little or no exercise, require regular purging every six
months, with two or three doses each time, allowing proper
intervals between each.</p>

<p>When the family travels post, the helper in
the stables, and the stable-boy, generally ride<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[408]</span>
as postillions: on other occasions, the boy or
helper, rides and drives the chariot and other
carriages; or if he be a regular servant, he
has the care of a pair of horses. Wages from
16 to 20 guineas.—His clothing is nearly the
same as the grooms, only that he has a cap,
and generally a jacket instead of a frock coat.</p>

cleaning out the stables, and assisting

<hr class="r10">

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE HEAD GARDENER.</p>


<p>The gardener, to understand his business
well, and to be capable of undertaking the
management of a gentleman’s garden and
grounds, should not only be perfect in the ordinary
business, and the regular routine of
digging, cropping, and managing a kitchen
garden, but should be also well versed in the
nature of soils, manures, and composts, the
best methods of propagating plants, shrubs,
and trees, the management of the hot-house,
green-house, conservatory, hot-beds; and the
culture, not only of indigenous, but also of
foreign and exotic productions.</p>

<p>The gardener, on first coming to his situation,
will endeavour to ascertain the nature and
present state of the soil. There are scarcely
any of the ordinary esculent or culinary vegetables
that will not require, at least, a depth of
two spits of well cultivated earth; shrubs and
trees much more; and this depth he should
accordingly give it by proper digging, trenching,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[410]</span>
and other means. The sub-strata, or under
soil, must also be considered, and articles
fond of moisture should be planted where the
sub-stratum is of a clayey nature, and will not
suffer the moisture imbibed from above to
pass off; while those which require warm and
dry situations, should be planted where the
under soil consists of sand or gravel, and will
the more readily absorb the moisture from
above.</p>

<p>In small families, or in gardens not exceeding
an acre, with a paddock of three or four
acres for a horse or cow, it is usual to keep
but one gardener, who, at an out-door salary
of a guinea a week, performs all the necessary
work in the garden, milks the cow, feeds
the poultry, and, sometimes, takes care of
the horse, his assistant being a jobbing labourer
during a few weeks of particular duty.
These gardeners generally consist of under
gardeners from large establishments, or from
market gardeners near large towns; and the
only questions which arise between them and
their employer, are the difficulties which they
feel at first in accommodating the practice on
a large scale to that on a small and economical
one; but, when reconciled to this, no
situation is more independent and comfortable
than that of the solitary and accommodating
gardener.</p>

<p>Gardeners generally prefer a sandy loam, of
a nature not too binding in summer, nor too
retentive in winter.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best practical rules that can be
given are the following, from the best Treatise
on Gardening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[411]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. <i>Perform every operation in the proper season.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Perform every operation in the best manner.</i></p>

<p>This is to be acquired in part by practice, and partly also
by reflection. For example, in digging over a piece of
ground, it is a common practice with slovens, to throw the
weeds and stones on the dug ground, or on the adjoining
alley or walk, with the intention of gathering them off afterwards.
A better way is to have a wheelbarrow, or a large
basket, into which to put the weeds and extraneous matters,
as they are picked out of the ground. Some persons
in planting or weeding, whether in the open air, or in hothouses,
throw down all seeds, stones, and extraneous matters
on the paths or alleys, with a view to pick them up, or
sweep or rake them together afterwards; it is better to carry
a basket or other utensil, either common or subdivided,
in which to hold in one part the plants to be planted, in
another the extraneous matters, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. <i>Complete every part of an operation as you proceed.</i></p>

<p>4. <i>Finish one job before beginning another.</i></p>

<p>5. <i>In leaving off working at any job, leave the work and tools
in an orderly manner.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>In leaving off work for the day, make a temporary finish,
and carry the tools to the tool-house.</i></p>

<p>7. <i>In passing to and from the work, or on any occasion,
through any part of what is considered under the charge of the
gardener, keep a vigilant look out for weeds, decayed leaves, or
any other deformity, and remove them.</i></p>

<p>8. <i>In gathering a crop, remove at the same time, the roots,
leaves, stems, or whatever else is of no farther use, or may appear
slovenly, decaying, or offensive.</i></p>

<p>9. <i>Let no crop of fruit, or herbaceous vegetables, go to waste
on the spot.</i></p>

<p>10. <i>Cut down the flower-stalks of all plants.</i></p>

<p>11. <i>Keep every part of what is under your care, perfect in
its kind.</i></p>

<p>Attend in spring and autumn to <i>walls and buildings</i>, and
get them repaired, jointed, glazed, and painted, where wanted.
Attend at all times to <i>machines, implements, and tools</i>,
keeping them clean, sharp, and in perfect repair. See particularly
that they are placed in their proper situations in the
tool-house. House every implement, utensil, or machine
not in use, both in winter and summer. Allow <i>no blanks</i>
in edgings, rows, single specimens, drills, beds, and even
where practicable, in broad-cast sown pieces. Keep edgings
and edges cut to the utmost nicety. Keep the shapes
of the <i>wall-trees</i> filled with wood according to their kinds,
and let their training be in the first style of perfection.
Keep all walks in perfect form, (whether raised or flat,) free
from weeds, dry, and well rolled. Keep all <i>the lawns</i> by
every means, of a close texture, and dark-green velvet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[412]</span>
appearance. <i>Keep water clear and free from weeds</i>, and let not
ponds, lakes, or artificial rivers, rise to the brim in winter,
nor sink very far under it in summer.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO SOW SEEDS WITH ADVANTAGE.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">This is the first operation of rearing. Where seeds are
deposited singly, as in rows of beans, or large ruts, they
are said to be planted; where dropt in numbers together, to
be sown. The operation of sowing is either performed in
drills, patches, or broadcast. Drills are small excavations
formed with the draw-hoe, generally in straight lines parallel
to each other, and in depth and distance apart, varying
according to the size of the seeds. In these drills, the seeds
are strewed from the hand of the operator, who, taking a
small quantity in the palm of his hand and fingers, regulates
its emission by the thumb. Some seeds are very thinly
sown, as the pea, and spinage; others thick, as the cress, and
small salad.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Patches are small circular excavations made with the
trowel; in these seeds are either sown or planted, thicker or
thinner, and covered more or less, according to their nature.
This is the mode adopted in sowing in pots, and generally in
flower-borders.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">In broad-cast sowing, the operator scatters the seed over
a considerable breadth of surface, previously prepared by
digging, or otherwise being minutely pulverized. The seed
is taken up in portions in the hand, and dispersed by a
horizontal movement of the arm, to the extent of a semi-circle,
opening the hand at the same time, and scattering the
seeds in the air, so as they may fall as equally as possible
over the breadth taken in by the sower at once, and which
is generally six feet; that being the diameter of the circle
in which his hand moves through half the circumference. In
sowing broad-cast on beds, and narrow’ strips or borders,
the seeds are dispersed between the thumb and fingers, by
horizontal movements of the hand in segments of smaller
circles.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Dry weather is essentially requisite for sowing, and more
especially for the operation of covering in the seed, which
in broad-cast sowing, is done by treading or gently rolling
the surface, and then raking it; and in drill-sowing, by
treading in the larger seeds, as peas, and covering with the
rake; smaller seeds, sown in drills, are covered with the
same implement, without treading.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO PLANT SHRUBS AND TREES.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Planting, as applied to seeds, or seed-like roots, as potatoes,
bulbs, &amp;c. is most frequently performed in drills, or
in separate holes made with the dibber; in these, the seed or
bulb is dropped from the hand, and covered with or without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">[413]</span>
treading, according to its nature. Sometimes planting is
performed in patches, as in pots or borders, in which case,
the trowel is the chief instrument used.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Quincunx is a mode of planting in rows, by which the
plants in one row are always opposed to the blanks in the
other, so that when a plot of ground is planted in this way,
the plants appear in rows in four directions.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Planting, as applied to plants already originated, consists
generally in inserting them in the soil of the same depth, and
in the same position as they were before removal, but with
various exceptions. The principal object is to preserve the
fibrous roots entire; to distribute them equally around the
stem among the mould or finer soil, and to preserve the plant
upright. The plant should not be planted deeper than it
stood in the soil before removal, and commonly the same
side should be kept towards the sun. Planting should, as
much as possible, be accompanied by abundant watering,
in order to consolidate the soil about the roots; and where
the soil is dry, or not a stiff clay, it may be performed in
the beginning of wet weather, in gardens; and in forest
planting, on dry soils, in all open weather during autumn,
winter, and spring.</p>
</div>


<p class="noindent center p1 bold small">TO WATER GARDENS.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="takeof-noindent">Watering becomes requisite in gardens for various purposes,
as aliment to plants in a growing state, to support
newly transplanted plants, for keeping under insects, and
keeping clean the leaves of vegetables. One general rule
must be ever kept in mind during the employment of watering
a garden; that is, never to water the top or leaves of a
plant when the sun shines. All watering should be carried
on in the evening or early in the morning, unless it be confined
to watering the roots, in which case, transplanted
plants, and others in a growing state, may be watered at any
time; and if they are shaded from the sun, they may also
be watered over their tops. Watering over the tops is performed
with the <i>rose</i>, or dispenser attached to the spout of
the watering-pot, or by the syringe or engine. Watering
the roots is best done with the rose; but in the case of watering-pots
in haste, and where the earth is hardened, it is done
with the naked spout.</p>

<p class="takeof-noindent">Many kitchen-crops are lost, or produced of very inferior
quality, for want of watering. Lettuces and cabbages
are often hard and stringy; turnips and radishes do not
swell, onions decay, cauliflowers die off, and, in general, in
dry soils. Copious waterings in the evenings, during the
dry season, would produce that fulness of succulency,
which are found in the vegetables produced in the low countries,
and in the Marsh Gardens at Paris; and in this country
at the beginning and latter end of the season.</p>

<p>The principal tools used by gardeners are, a
light handy spade, a shovel, rake, with iron
teeth, hoe, three-pronged fork, dibber, or setting-stick,
line and reel, usually called a skillet,
wheelbarrow, baskets, trowel, a pair of
shears, scythe, hay-rake, hook, ladder, besom,
or broom, beater, garden-roller, turfing-iron,
hatchet, and hammer. The gardener
usually wears a blue woollen apron, which,
when he is pruning, he ties up before him, and
then serves to hold his nails, shreds, scissors,
hammer, and pruning-knife. He should also
be provided with a light measuring rod,
flat and narrow, painted and divided on one
side into feet and half feet, and on the other
into yards and half yards; with this he will
be able to measure distances, to lay out his
beds for sowing and planting, and to measure
and lay down his gravel-walks, grass-plats,
&amp;c. A table, that will be very useful to him
in laying out beds, or any quantity of ground,
large or small, will be found in the <span class="smcap">Appendix</span>.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold">THE GARDENER’S CALENDAR.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold small"><i>Containing useful Information for every Month in the Year.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>January.</i> If the weather be open and dry, sow, upon
warm compartments, small portions of peas, beans, cabbage,
spinage, carrots, parsley, radish, lettuce, and onions,
and preserve them from the cold by mats. Also, in hot-beds,
cucumbers, melons, small salading, best early and red
cabbage, kidney beans, and cauliflowers. Plant cabbages,
horse-radish, beans, and mint roots. The cucumbers and
melons this month require particular attention. They ought
to receive air by small degrees, as often as possible.</p>

<p><i>February.</i> Sow small salading, radishes, onions, parsley,
spinage, lettuce, peas, beans, cabbage, cauliflowers, carrots,
parsnips, fennel, &amp;c. Plant cabbages, &amp;c. as last month.
The cucumber and melon plants raised last month, should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[415]</span>
be transplanted about the middle of this into new hot-beds.
The ground should be prepared for planting asparagus next
month.</p>

<p><i>March.</i> Sow, in this month, principal crops of carrots,
early turnips, radishes, onions, cabbage, celery, cauliflowers,
spinage, lettuce, asparagus, peas, and beans. Sow asparagus
for the new plantations of the next year. Make
new asparagus beds, and fork the old ones.</p>

<p><i>April.</i> Sow and plant, as in the former month, for a later
crop. Towards the middle of the month dung should be
prepared for ridges of melons and cucumbers. Snails and
slugs ought to be killed, and weeds kept down; otherwise
they will increase so fast as to render their destruction difficult.</p>

<p><i>May.</i> The principal crops sowed and planted in the
spring will now require weeding, hoeing, and thinning, and
some transplanting. The melon beds require an equal degree
of heat; and the glasses must be covered every night
through the month with mats; but in the middle of the day
they must be raised to the breadth of two or three fingers.
Cucumbers in frames must receive a moderate supply of
water, and be planted out under hand-glasses.</p>

<p><i>June.</i> Particular attention is now required in weeding,
hoeing, thinning, and watering the principal crops, and
pricking out and transplanting for autumn and winter. Sow
savoys, brocoli, borecole, cabbages, turnips, carrots, spinage,
coleworts, kidney beans, lettuce, endive, celery, cucumbers,
radishes, peas, beans, and small salading. Plant
cabbages, colewort, savoys, brocoli, borecole, leeks, beans,
lettuce, endive, celery, cucumbers, radishes, peas, and beans.
Melon plants must be shaded in the heat of the day, and receive
a large portion of fresh air. Transplant endive for
blanching, and prick out young brocoli plants, which were
sown in April or May.</p>

<p><i>July.</i> Prepare ground for the reception of succession
crops, and some main crops for autumn and winter, and sow
turnips, &amp;c. as at the beginning of the year. The common
radishes sown now will be fit to draw the beginning of September;
and the cauliflowers sown in May must be planted
out in spots where they are to remain. The beds of carrots
sown now will be fit to draw early in April. Spinage
for winter may now be sown, and onions taken up if the
leaves wither.</p>

<p><i>August.</i> Asparagus beds planted in March must now be
cleared; celery transplanted and earthed, and the heads or
suckers taken from the March artichokes. The early cabbage
seed must not be sown later than the 12th of this
month; but lettuce seed may be put in as late as the 24th.
The cauliflower seed will not do without covering, and the
spinage sown last month will require hoeing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[416]</span></p>

<p><i>September.</i> Sow spinage, lettuce, onions, radishes, cabbages, colewort,
chervil, corn-salad, borage, coriander, turnips,
and successions of small salading. Plant savoys,
cabbages, coleworts, brocoli, borecole, lettuces, leeks,
celery, endive, and perennial, aromatic, and pot-herbs. Make
mushroom beds, and cut down the haulm of asparagus, clean
the beds and dung them if necessary. Hoe your turnips,
and weed onions. The cauliflowers of last month must be
weeded out, and cabbage-plants pricked. Of the lettuces
sown last month some may be put into warm borders for
spring use, and others planted under frames for pulling in
December and January. The different seeds must be gathered
as they ripen.</p>

<p><i>October.</i> Sow a small crop of radishes and lettuces, successions
of small salading, and a few early peas to come in
next summer. Plant crops of cabbage, cauliflowers, late
brocoli, celery, lettuce, early beans. Keep uncovered
night and day, for the greater part of this month, such
cauliflowers as are planted in frames. All spare ground
should be dunged and trenched.</p>

<p><i>November.</i> Most of the processes used last month will also
be appropriate for this. Such as giving air to lettuce and cauliflower
plants that are under frames. Cut down the leaves
of artichokes and earth up the plants.</p>

<p><i>December.</i> Forward the digging, manuring, or trenching
vacant ground, preparing hot dung, making hot-beds, and
earthing and tying up plants. Sow a few early peas and
radishes on warm borders, and small salading and cucumbers
in hot-beds. Plant early beans, strong cabbage-plants, and
coleworts; and plant in hot-beds, cucumbers, mint, tarragon,
and asparagus. The small salads may be sown every
ten days, under frames; and such radish seed as may be put
into the ground this month, should be covered on cold
nights with fern, or long litter.</p>

<p>These men are entirely under the controul
and direction of the <i>head gardener</i>, and are
employed by him, for the most part, in digging
and trenching, wheeling, dunging,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[417]</span>
gravelling, hoeing, mowing, and other laborious
work.</p>

<p>They are engaged as weekly servants, and
are paid according to their abilities, from 16
to 20 or 21 shillings per week, and vegetables.
Some <i>under gardeners</i> have a cottage assigned
for themselves and families, and others have
also fuel allowed them for their fires.</p>

<p class="noindent center p1 bold" style="font-size: 110%;">THE SERVANTS’ HALL.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> large establishments, the housekeeper, the
lady’s maid, and the men servants out of livery,
usually take their meals by themselves,
in the housekeeper’s or steward’s room; but
when they take their dinner together, they preserve
an order at table like the following:—The
housekeeper usually takes her seat at the
head, and the butler at the lower end of the
table; the cook at the right of the housekeeper,
and the lady’s maid on her left; the
under butler on the right, and the coachman
on the left of the butler; the house-maid
next to the cook, and the kitchen-maid next
to the lady’s-maid; and the men servants always
occupying the lower end of the table.
The dinner is set on the table by the cook,
and the beer is drawn by the under butler.</p>

<p>The servants’ table is usually provided with
solid dishes, and with ale and table beer; and
it is the business of the superior servants to see
that their accommodation is comfortable and
in plenty, but without extravagance, or waste
and riot. In well-regulated families, the servants’
hall is distinguished by its decorum,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[418]</span>
good order, and even good manners, which
the servants who wait in the parlour imbibe,
and convey to the kitchen. Servants of coarse
manners, vulgar habits, or profane discourse,
and malicious dispositions, are shunned by
others, and never make good their footing or
rise in first-rate families, where all the good
and bad qualities which belong to the superior
ranks of society operate as much to their
advantage or disadvantage as in any station of
life. In truth, the servants’ hall is a little world
by itself, in which the passions, tempers, vices,
and virtues, are brought into play, and contribute
their full share in promoting that welfare
and happiness, which it is the object of
this work to fix and improve.</p>

<p><i>His lawful commands every where gladly do;</i> that
is, he shall readily and cheerfully obey him in all things
lawful, without murmuring, hesitation, or reluctance;
for obedience from a Servant to his Master, is a duty
established by all laws, human and divine; and is
founded likewise in the very nature of things; it being
impossible to preserve any superiority in the one over
the other, unless the inferior submits himself to the
direction of his superior in all such things as he has a
right to command him to do; that is, all things lawful:
he is indeed, properly speaking, no longer a
Servant than while he obeys his Master’s commands;
so that the covenanted obedience of an Apprentice is
on all accounts indispensably necessary; and the more
cheerfully he performs it, the more perfectly he fulfils
his duty, and the greater will be the reward as well
as pleasure of his obedience; for his Master will
doubtless take all opportunities of encouraging him on
account of his willingness; he will contrive to make
his work as easy to him as he can; he will treat him
with all the kindness, and shew him all the favour that
is consistent with the relation between them; whereby
his servitude will be rendered a kind of freedom; the
necessary labours of it a delight; and the time of its
duration short and pleasant: he will beside gain the
advantage of being trusted and confided in by his
Master, which must necessarily give him a quick and
thorough insight into his trade, whereby he will become
duly qualified for the power and dignity of a Master
himself, and establish such a reputation and character
as will gain him the esteem and friendship of all who
know him; and can therefore have no other than a
comfortable prospect of advancing his station and
fortune in the world. The quite contrary of all which
must be the lot of the disobedient, churlish, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">[422]</span>
murmuring Servant; who will, in all probability, end
his days as a Master (if ever he arrives at that honour)
in the same discontented, uneasy, and disregarded
manner, in which he lived as a Servant; feared by
very few, beloved by none.</p>

does not wrong his Master himself, by cheating,
pilfering, purloining, wasting, spoiling, lending,
or giving away any of his goods; by sloth and idleness,
by neglecting his business, and loitering away his time;
it is not enough that he does his Master no kind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">[423]</span>

<p><i>Nor contract matrimony within the said term.</i>
Marriage is a very improper state for Apprentices, but
is too often entered into rashly without consideration,
or the consent of friends and relations; and therefore
is very seldom advantageous, and generally unhappy.
The necessary expense and charge which attends a
growing family, must quite consume a small fortune,
very much lessen a good one, and entail heavy debts
and lasting misery on the generality of married Apprentices,
who cannot hope to avoid a jail; and it is well
if that is their worst misfortune. At best such a
marriage is an act of great disobedience and contempt
towards parents and friends, of injustice towards the
Master, and must be attended with the loss of their
esteem and friendship, if not with their heavy displeasure.
It is a direct violation of this covenant, <i>a
forfeiture of their right to the freedom of</i> London,
and tends to unsettle and alienate the mind from
business, and to disable the Apprentice from ever
becoming a complete master of his trade.</p>

<p><i>He shall not play at cards, dice, tables, or any other
unlawful game, whereby his said Master may have
any loss.</i> All sorts of gaming for money is prohibited
by this covenant; it being a habit of the most pernicious
consequence. Those who have an itch for gaming,
very rarely have any relish for business; the dispositions
and qualifications for the one, being quite inconsistent
with the other. Modesty, caution, industry,
frugality, and strict integrity, are indispensably necessary
to the forming a good and successful tradesman;
but no man ever made his fortune by play, without
corrupting his morals and forfeiting his character; for
the gamester must be bold and adventurous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">[425]</span>
extravagant and profuse, fraudulent, tricking, and deceitful,
of scandalous life, and infamous reputation; and such
will the unwary and thoughtless Apprentice soon become,
who is addicted to this vice; who begins with
it under pretence of amusement, but suffers the love
of it to grow on him till it becomes habitual; and
what assurance has he, that the loss of his own money,
and the flattering hopes of better fortune, will not
tempt him to steal and hazard what is his Master’s?
What hopes can he have that he shall escape the rock
on which so many have perished? The Apprentice
therefore who would not expose himself to guilt, to
shame, punishment, and ruin, must religiously observe
this prohibition.</p>

<p><i>With his own goods, or others, during the said
term, without license of his said Master, he shall
neither buy nor sell.</i> The apprenticeship is a time of
labour and improvement, not of gain; it is the season
wherein youth are to acquire a thorough knowledge
of trade, and to establish in themselves such habits as
will enable them to carry it on hereafter with pleasure
and profit. A liberty for the Apprentice to trade on
his own account, would, in most instances, be rather
a snare than an advantage to him; it would oftener
increase his acquaintance and expenses than his fortune;
it would furnish him with excuses for absenting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">[426]</span>
himself from his Master’s house and business, under
pretence of promoting his own; and lead him into
company-keeping, and a large acquaintance, before he
hath judgment to make a proper choice; and it is to
be feared, would sometimes be the occasion of his
being unfaithful, and create continual jealousies and
misunderstandings between him and his Master. Upon
all which accounts this prohibition is for their mutual
advantage; and the breach of it on no account to be
connived at by the Master, nor practised by the
Apprentice.</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot3">

<p class="noindent">If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s,
who shall give you that which is your own?</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot2">

<p><i>He shall not haunt taverns or play-houses, nor
absent himself from his said Master’s service day or
night unlawfully.</i> I have joined these three prohibitions
together, because of the connexion they have;
the Apprentice cannot commit the two first without
being guilty of the last, which is a great act of injustice;
for the Master has not a better title to his own
money or goods than to the time of his Apprentice.
He therefore must not upon any pretence whatsoever
absent himself day or night from his Master’s house,
without his consent. He must not, when the common
business of the day is over, think himself at his own
disposal, and take the liberty of going on his pleasure,
without permission. Many things may occur which
require his presence: business sometimes offers very
unexpectedly; and the Apprentice should be always
ready for his Master’s service. Add to this, that the
house, the shop, and effects of his Master, are continually
under his care, and the looking well after them
a duty always incumbent on him; which such a one
can never faithfully discharge who lists himself in
clubs, or haunts taverns, or any other kind of tippling
houses, or who frequents play-houses, and such like
diversions. These habits are not only attended with a
great waste of the Master’s time, but with an expense
which few Apprentices can afford, and will probably
lead him from wrong to robbery, when the Master’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">[427]</span>
money becomes as necessary to his pleasures as his
time; for, he who scruples not to waste the one, will
not be long before he makes free with the other. It is
therefore the interest and happiness of youth, to be
restrained from frequenting these places, where they
can only associate themselves with the young and
giddy, the raw and inexperienced, the loose and disorderly;
for discreet and prudent persons will not
encourage Apprentices in such unlawful haunts, by
keeping them company. And what must be the fruits
of such society? what, but noisy empty mirth; loose
and licentious discourse, riot, intemperance, and disorder;
of the same pernicious kind are the pleasures they
receive from plays, interludes, and such like diversions.
These, to youthful and unsettled judgments, are but
vain and airy entertainments, which fill the head with
romantic and unnatural ideas of life and the world, and
tend only to alienate the mind from business, which is
its proper, and ought to be its chief entertainment;
and to expose youth to the danger of being corrupted
by lewd and vicious persons of both sexes, who always
crowd such places. Upon the whole, then, it is evident,
the Apprentice cannot haunt taverns, that is, any
kind of public tippling-houses, or frequent play-houses,
nor absent himself day or night from his Master’s service,
without breach of covenant, nor indeed without
exposing himself to the loss of reputation (for such as
his companions and pleasures are, such will his character
be) and contracting vicious and expensive habits,
which will probably bring him to want and misery,
to shame and punishment.</p>

the indispensable duty of every Master to use <i>his best
means</i>, that is, to take all proper methods for performance
of these covenants. He must endeavour to render
his Apprentice skilful and industrious, by due information
and constant employment: he must enforce the
duties of diligence, frugality, and honesty, by his own
example, by kind and gentle usage, and by instilling
into his mind the necessity and usefulness of these and
all other good and virtuous habits. He must restrain
him from whatever interferes with his duty or obstructs
his improvement, by advice, by exhortation, by reproof,
and (if need be) by moderate and reasonable correction;
and if all these prove ineffectual, he must apply
to the magistrate, and call to his assistance the authority
of the Chamberlain, who will judge indifferently between
the Master and the Apprentice, and oblige both
parties to perform the covenants of their Indentures.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">The figures in the first column of each table denote the number
of pounds, yards, &amp;.; and the money columns are headed with
the respective prices of the article. So, if you want to know
what 19&#160;lbs. of beef come to at 5½d. per lb. look for the column
headed 5½d. (<a href="#Table_III">Table III.</a>) and opposite to 19 in the first column,
under that head you will find 8s. 8½d., which is the amount. In
this manner the price of any quantity of goods, at any price,
may be instantly ascertained.</p>

<p class="noindent center p2 bold">LAWS</p>

<p class="noindent center p2 x-small">RESPECTING MASTERS AND SERVANTS IN GENERAL.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="appndx-font">The nature of the contract between Masters and Servants,
is simple, and may be clearly defined by the existing
laws; of which the following are the most material points;
and ought to be well understood, both by masters and
servants.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Hiring Servants.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">The contract between a master and his domestic servant
is called the <i>Hiring</i>, and may be made either in writing, or
by verbal agreement; but, in the latter case, there should
be a witness.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>General Hiring.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">If the hiring of a servant be <i>general</i>, without any
particular time specified, the law construes it to be a hiring
<i>for a year certain</i>. But, before the expiration of the
year, three months’ notice, at least, <i>must</i> be given by either
party, or the service is continued for another year, and so
on; as under a general hiring, the servant can never become
a servant <i>at will</i>.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Particular Hiring.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">In London, and other great towns, the common mode of
hiring is by <i>a month’s warning, or a month’s wages</i>; that is,
the parties agree to separate on either of them giving to
the other a month’s notice of his intention; or, in lieu of
that, the party requiring the separation is to pay or give up
a month’s wages: and this kind of hiring is sanctioned by
law. But the contract may be made for any longer or
shorter time; 5 Eliz. c. 4.</p>


<p><i>A yearly Servant is intitled to his Wages for the time of
actual Service.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">If a servant be hired in a general way, he is considered
as hired with reference to the general understanding on the
subject, and shall be entitled to his wages for the time he
has served, though he do not continue in the service during
the whole year; and if he die before the end of the year,
his representatives will be entitled to so much wages as was
due to him at the time of his death.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Of Discharging Servants.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">A yearly servant cannot leave his place, nor be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10A">[10]</span>
discharged, without a quarter’s warning, or wages, under
the penalty of 40s.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">If a servant be hired for a year certain, or for any indefinite
time, which is construed in law, to be for a year,
his master cannot discharge him either before, or at the
end of the term, nor afterwards, without giving a quarter
of a year’s previous warning, before a witness;—unless for
some cause which shall be deemed sufficient by a magistrate,
under the forfeiture of 40s.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">And, as a master cannot discharge a yearly servant
without a quarter’s warning, given previous to the expiration
of the year; neither can a servant leave his place
without a similar notice, under pain of imprisonment, and
of losing all his wages.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">A servant leaving his place without giving regular notice,
or neglecting his master’s business, or disobeying his
orders, (which is considered as a departure from his service,)
or being guilty of any other misconduct, may be
punished by three months’ imprisonment, or in lieu thereof,
with the loss of a part or the whole of his wages, <i>at the
discretion of a justice</i>.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>The Parties may part by mutual consent.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">A master and his servant may part by mutual consent,
without any forfeiture on either part;—or, for a cause to be
allowed by a justice.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>A Servant may be discharged for any moral Crime.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">If a servant be guilty of any moral infamy whilst in his
master’s service, he may discharge him without application
to a justice.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">Also, if he be taken into custody for any offence, and legally
detained, so that he cannot attend to his duties, the
master is authorized to discharge him. But, if the offence
of which the servant is accused was committed before
the time of hiring, the master cannot discharge him without
the order of a justice.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>A yearly Servant cannot be discharged for any act of God.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">A master cannot discharge his yearly servant within the
year, by reason of illness, or of any hurt by which he may
be disabled from doing his usual business, nor even for insanity,
without an order from a justice; nor can his wages
be abated for such reason.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>A Servant may be discharged by a Justice if his Wages be
not paid, or sufficient Maintenance be denied him.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">The master detaining a servant’s wages, or not allowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11A">[11]</span>
him sufficient meat and drink, or otherwise ill-treating him,
is a good cause for a servant’s leaving his place; <i>but it must
be allowed by a justice</i>.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Punishment for insolence after Warning given.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">If, after warning given, a servant is insolent, or refuses
to do his duty, a magistrate may commit him to prison for
the time he has to serve; but the master must pay him his
wages whilst there.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Punishment for an assault on the Master or Mistress.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">If a servant assault his master or mistress, or any other
person having charge over him, he may be bound to his
good behaviour; or be committed to prison, for a year or
less, at the discretion of two magistrates.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Agreement by a Servant under age not to operate against him.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">No agreement made by a servant, with his master, whilst
he is under the age of 21 years, can be made to operate
against him.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>A married Woman must serve her term.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">A woman who is married, or shall marry during her
servitude, must, in either case, serve out her time; nor can
her husband take her out of her master’s service.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>A Woman with Child may be discharged by a Justice.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">Should a woman with child be hired for a term, and her
master knew not of it, or should she prove with child during
her servitude, he may discharge her, with the concurrence
of a magistrate.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">But if, when he knows it, he does not discharge her before
a magistrate, but keeps her on, he must provide for her till
her delivery, and for one month after; when she is to be
sent to her place of settlement.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Servants must go to Church.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">Masters can insist on their servants going to church;
and every person whose servant shall be absent from church,
for one month, at a time, without a reasonable excuse, forfeits
10<i>l.</i> for every month he so keeps that servant.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Punishment for gaming.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">A servant gaming at a public house, with cards, dice,
draughts, or at any game, is liable to be taken before a
magistrate, and fined from 5<i>s.</i> to 20<i>s.</i> one-fourth of which
goes to the informer; and he may be committed to hard
labour for a month, or till the penalty is paid.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Punishment for getting Drunk.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">Every person convicted of having been drunk, within six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12A">[12]</span>
months previous to the information, before one justice, on
the oath of one witness, forfeits 5<i>s.</i> for the first offence,
or may be set in the stocks six hours; and for the second
offence must give good security not to offend again.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Punishment for Cursing and Swearing.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">Any servant who may be convicted of cursing and
swearing, within eight days of the offence, before one
justice, shall forfeit 1<i>s.</i> for the first offence; 2<i>s.</i> for the
second; and 3<i>s.</i> for the third; or be committed to hard
labour for ten days.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>The Interest a Master has in his Servant.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">The master can maintain an action for injury done to his
servant; or for enticing him away, or for detaining him.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">From the interest that a master acquires in his servant,
by reason of the wages he pays him, if the servant be
maimed or disabled in his master’s service through the
fault of another, the master may recover from that other,
for loss of his service. Also, for this reason, a man may
maintain an action against another for enticing away his
servant; or for detaining him after demanded;—or for
retaining him with a knowledge of his having left him
clandestinely: for this latter offence an action is maintainable
against the servant also, or against both.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>A Master may protect his Servant, and may assist him to
prosecute a Stranger.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">A master may be justified in assaulting another in protection
of his servant; or, he may assist his servant in
supporting the expense of an action at law against a stranger; though
in general it is deemed an offence against public
justice to encourage animosities by such assistance.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>A Servant is bound to defend his Master.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">The master may demand the aid of his servant, and the
servant may stand up in his master’s or mistress’s defence
without being liable to punishment.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>The Master is liable for the Acts of his Servant.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">The acts of servants are, in most instances, deemed the
acts of their masters. In fact, every man ought to transact
his own business; and though by the indulgence of the
law, he can delegate the power of acting for him to another,
yet, it is with reason, that the acts of his substitute, being
pursuant to his authority, should be considered as the acts
of himself. It is, therefore, a rule of law, that whatever
trespass a servant commits by the order, encouragement, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13A">[13]</span>
with the tacit consent of his master, the master shall be
answerable for it. Generally, a master is responsible for
all acts done by his servant in the course of his ordinary
and proper business, even though he has given him no
express commands. The master is also liable for any
fault or neglect of his servant whilst executing his <i>lawful</i>
commands. But, in all such inexcusable cases, the servant
is punishable by the criminal laws, and is also liable to
civil actions.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Servants not answerable but for wilful Neglect, or Fraud.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">A servant cannot be made answerable to his master for
any loss that may happen without his wilful neglect; but if
he be guilty of fraud or gross negligence, an action will lie
against him by his master. Therefore, if a master give
money or other thing to a servant to carry to a certain
place, and he is robbed, the servant is not answerable.—But
if it be lost through his neglect he is punishable.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Servants setting fire to a House.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">A servant negligently setting fire to a house, shall, on
the oath of one witness, be made to pay one hundred pounds,
to be distributed among the sufferers; or be committed to
hard labour, in prison, for eighteen months.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Embezzlement of a Master’s property is Felony.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">If money, goods, bills, bonds, notes, bankers’-drafts, or
other valuable security, or effects, be delivered to a servant,
or clerk, to keep, and he go away with them, or embezzle,
secrete, or otherwise convert either, or any of them, to his
own use, it is felony; if he be more than 18 years of age.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">If any servant shall purloin, or make away with his
master’s goods to the value of 40<i>s.</i> it is felony, and he shall,
himself, his aider, or abettor, on conviction, be transported
for 14 years. Or, if a master deliver the key of a room to
a servant, and he steal therein to the amount of 12<i>d.</i> it is
felony.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Servants pawning their Master’s property.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">Servants pawning their master’s goods without orders,
shall forfeit 40<i>s.</i> and the value of the goods so pawned;
or be sent to the House of Correction for three months,
and be publickly whipped.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Mode of settling disputes for Wages, and other matters.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">Disputes with servants for wages under 10<i>l.</i> a year, and
other matters, may be referred to a magistrate, who is
authorized to redress such complaints. But magistrates
in the metropolis can take no cognizance of the wages of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14A">[14]</span>
coachmen, grooms, &amp;c. as they come within the jurisdiction
of the Commissioners of Hackney-Coaches, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div>
<p class="noindent center p2 bold">OF FALSE CHARACTERS.</p>

<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>Punishment for bringing false Characters.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">If any person shall falsely personate any master or mistress,
or his or her representative, and shall either verbally
or in writing, give a false, forged, or counterfeit character to
any person, offering him or herself to be hired as a servant;
or, if any person shall pretend or assert, in writing, that
any servant had been hired for any period of time, or in
any station whatsoever, other than the true one, or that he
was discharged, or left his service; or that such servant
had not been hired in any previous service contrary to the
truth.-Or, if any person shall offer him or herself as a servant,
pretending that he hath served in any service, in which he
hath not served; or with a false, forged, or counterfeit
certificate of character; or shall in anywise add to, or
alter, efface, or erase any word, date, matter, or thing, in
any certificate given to him by his last or former actual
master, or person authorized by him; or, if any person,
having before been in service, shall, when offering himself
to hire, falsely pretend not to have been hired in any former
service; such person convicted of any, or either, of these
offences, by the oath of one witness, (the informer to be
deemed a competent witness,) before two justices, shall
forfeit 20<i>l.</i> one half to go to the informer, and the other
half to the poor of the parish, together with 10<i>s.</i> the costs
of conviction; or on failure, be committed to hard labour
in the House of Correction, for not less than one month,
nor more than three, or, till the penalty and costs be paid.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">And, if any servant so offending, shall give information
against any accomplice, so that he be convicted, such
servant shall be acquitted.</p>


<p class="noindent center appndx-font"><i>No Action will lie against a Master for a bad Character
unless it be maliciously given.</i></p>

<p class="appndx-font">No action can be maintained by a servant against his
former master for a bad character, given either verbally or
in writing, unless it can be proved that the character given
was not only <i>false</i> but <i>malicious</i>.</p>

<p class="appndx-font p2"><i>Number of Passengers.</i>—Coaches are not compellable to
take more than four adults in the inside, and a servant
out; but if the coachman agree to take more, the fare
will be 1s. for each extra person, of whatever age he or
she may be, not being a child in arms, or less; and if
taken in the country, 1s. for going, and 1s. for returning.—Chariots
are not compellable to take more than two adults
or grown up persons, and children in arms or less, but
if the coachman should agree to carry, or should actually
carry, above that number, he shall be paid at the same rate
as in the preceding article respecting coaches.</p>

<p class="appndx-font"><i>Abusive Language.</i>—The drivers of coaches and carriers
of chairs, on demanding more than their fare, or giving
abusive language, are to forfeit not more than 5l., and in
default of the payment, they are to be sent to the house of
correction seven days.</p>

<p class="appndx-font"><i>Extortion.</i>—Coachmen refusing to go on, or extorting
more than their fare, are to forfeit not more than 3l., nor
less than 10s. Not only commissioners, but also justices,
may determine offences, and inflict punishments.</p>

<p class="appndx-font"><i>Returning from the Country.</i>—Coaches hired to go into
the country, in the day-time, are to have for their return
empty, for ten miles 5s.; eight miles 4s.; six miles 3s.;
and for four miles 2s.; but there is no allowance for less
than four miles.</p>

<p class="appndx-font"><i>Obligation to go on.</i>—They shall be compellable on
every day, and at any hour of the night (unless they shall
have been out twelve hours, or have other reasonable excuse),
to go upon all turnpike roads, any where within two
miles and a half from the end of the carriage-way pavement.</p>

<p class="appndx-font"><i>Tickets or Certificates.</i>—By 54 Geo. III. c. 147, before
any driver of a coach or chariot shall be entitled to receive
the amount of his fare, he shall deliver as many tickets
marked on some “one shilling,” and on others “one shilling
and sixpence,” (and having his Majesty’s arms, with
the words “Hackney-Coach Office,” the number of his
coach and chariot, and dated,) as shall by the sums printed
thereon, in the aggregate, make the full amount of such
fare.</p>

<p class="appndx-font"><i>Option of Fares or Distance.</i>—Fares to be calculated for
time or distance, at the option of the coachman, and not by
the day, as heretofore.</p>

<p class="appndx-font"><i>Time of Sunset.</i>—As the period of sunset has been found
constantly liable to dispute, it is therefore now regulated
that the sunset hours shall be after eight in the evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24A">[24]</span>
between Lady-day and Michaelmas, and after five in the
evening between Michaelmas and Lady-day; and the back-carriage
after such hours shall be taken to the carriage-way
pavement, or next standing beyond which the coach
was hired from, (if hired at any stand off the pavement) at
the full fare back to either, at the option of the party
discharging.</p>

<p class="appndx-font"><i>Articles left in a Coach.</i>—By a late Act, all parcels, &amp;c.
left in a hackney coach are to be taken to the Hackney-Coach
Office, on pain of paying 20l.; to be recovered on
application to the commissioners or a justice.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">The coachman can demand his fare from the place he is taken
from, either for time, if he be kept waiting, or for distance.
He is to take the shortest way, and to charge accordingly;
but if he, from choice or ignorance, does otherwise, he can
make no extra charge.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">The coachman may refuse to take heavy luggage, unless
he be paid something more than the fare; but he must object
to it before it be put into the coach; he cannot, however,
object to take small trunks, or parcels that may be
carried in the hand.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">If a coach be drawn off the stand to the side of the pavement,
the coachman may be made to go with you, if not
hired, or if he refuses, he is liable to be fined.</p>

<p class="appndx-font"><i>Note</i>—When a coach is intended to be kept waiting, notice
should be taken of the time when it is called, in order to
prevent disputes; and the coachman may demand a deposit.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">Always take the number of the coach you hire, that,
in case any thing be left in it, or the coachman conduct
himself improperly, he may be summoned.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">The ancient Romans in their notation made use of the following seven letters;
viz. I. V. X. L. C. D. and M. which singly stood for one, five, ten, fifty, one
hundred, five hundred, and one thousand. By repeating and combining these
any other numbers were formed.</p>

<p class="appndx-font">The <i>annexing</i> a less number to a greater increases its value, and denotes the
sum of both; as VI. signifies six. The <i>prefixing</i> a less number to a greater lessens
its value, or shews their difference; thus, IV. is four, &amp;c. The word thousand
is often expressed by a line drawn over the top of a number; thus, X̅. signifies ten thousand.</p>

Lose not a <i>moment of time</i> in placing the dinner on the
table in proper order, and let not only every dish be as hot
as possible, but every plate also, else the whole dinner will
be spoiled. The cook’s labour will be lost if the cloth be
not laid in the parlour, and all the paraphernalia of the
dinner table completely arranged an hour before dinner.
An invitation to dinner at five generally means six—at five
precisely, half past five—and not later than five, five
o’clock exactly, so that the dinner may be served up a few
minutes after.</p>

Good families generally allow the footman a proper
dress of this sort, exclusive of his liveries, as it is equally
creditable to both master and servant, that the livery he is
to appear in, when attending his ordinary avocations, should
be kept clean, and look respectable. If it were always to be
well and clearly understood, between every master and the
servants to whom he gives livery, what shall be the number
and kind of garments, to be given yearly, or otherwise, and
that to be made a rule, from which no deviation should be
made, it would prevent much of the unpleasant feeling on
this subject, which has frequently been found to arise subsequent
to the agreement.</p>

Fourteen pounds of hay a day, or one hundred pounds
per week, with three feeds of corn a day, is deemed sufficient
for a horse that is not over worked.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="noindent"><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="label">[25]</a>
The feed given to each horse, worked in the usual way
is, a quartern of oats and a few beans, three times a day,
with some chaff, or not, as may be desired. In the choice
of oats, the shorter and fuller the grain the better; when bitten
in two, they should be dry and mealy: they should feel
hard in the hand, and when hard grasped should slip
through the fingers; oats with thin bodies and long tails are
the worst. When brought by sea, if they have lain long in
bulk, they will have become heated, and have acquired a
musty smell, to counteract which the corn dealers, when
they are brought into their granaries, spread them thin on
an upper floor, and turn them frequently, to cool, after
which, they pass them through screens placed under holes in
the floors, from the upper to the lower floors, which
sweetens them much, and frequently enables the corn dealers
to pass them off on inexperienced Coachmen and
Grooms as fresh farmer’s oats, which latter it will always be
best to buy. As horses should always be fed with fresh clean
corn, it would be well to rounce them in a hair bag, which
takes off all the tails and filth, and they should afterwards
be passed through a sieve, to free them from dust and other
extraneous matter, at the time of feeding.</p>

<p class="noindent">The finest-conditioned horses in England are fed thus:
When at grass, equal quantities of oats and old white peas;
when in the stable, two thirds oats and one third old white
peas.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">This book has two authors and includes text and tables from many
sources that are displayed in varying typographical styles. As a
consequence the original manuscript is inconsistent in layout,
spelling, accenting, capitalisation, etc.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">Where there was a predominant use of a hyphen in a word the hyphenation
of that word has been regularised. Other inconsistencies in the
orginal manuscript have generally been retained in this transcription
with some exceptions noted below. Typographical errors have been
corrected without note and unbalanced quotation marks have been
remedied when the change was obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="TN-style-1">The more than 400 recipes/receipts in this transcription have been
formatted in a consistent style which is faithful to the pattern
used in the original publication.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">Other changes include:</p>

<p class="TN-style-2">Page 225 – “Comsommé” changed to “Consommé” (A rich soup or gravy)
<p class="TN-style-2">Page 2 in Appendix – corrected an obviously wrong daily rate in last
                       line of A TABLE OF WAGES OR INCOME (1  7  5¾)</p>
<p class="TN-style-2">Page 37 in Appendix – Added missing header: “TO THE OFFICERS OF HIS
                       MAJESTY’S HOUSEHOLD.”</p>
<p class="TN-style-2">Page 38 in Appendix – “exemplagratia” changed to “exempli gratia”
                        (exempli gratia. For example)</p>
<p class="TN-style-2">Page 42 in Appendix – “A Draft payable” changed to “A Draft is payable”
                        (N.B. A Draft is payable)</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="TN-style-1">In the original manuscript, the months of May, June and July are
missing from the table of “Abbreviations and Characters, in Common Use”
on Page 41 in the Appendix. This may be deliberate as those months have
short names. The omission has not been corrected in this transcription.</p>

<hr class="r10">

<p class="TN-style-1">Index entries have been styled consistently and typographical errors
fixed. Other minor corrections to the Index have been made without note.</p>

<p class="TN-style-1">Most footnotes have been re-indexed using numbers and moved to a
FOOTNOTES section at the end of the transcription. The exceptions are
the footnotes on page 1 and page 42 of the APPENDIX. These have not
been re-indexed/moved and remain at the foot of their respective page. They also
retain the original footnote anchor symbols.</p>

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
